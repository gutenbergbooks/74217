<h3>DOWN IN A PIPE</h3>


<p>“Now it’s Freddie’s turn!” called Nan
Bobbsey. “Get ready to catch the ball,” and
she motioned, showing that she was going to
toss it to her small brother.</p>

<p>“No, I want to have it once more!” cried
Flossie, who was Freddie’s twin sister. “Come
on, Nan! Please throw it to me!” and she
jumped up and down, her light, fluffy hair
tossing about her head. It was cold out in
the yard where the children were playing, and
that is one reason why Flossie jumped up and
down. Another reason was that she was excited
about the ball game Nan had gotten up
for the smaller twins. “Come on, toss it to
me!” begged Flossie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>“But it isn’t your turn, dear!” objected
Nan. “It’s Freddie’s turn. He wants to
catch, too,” and she held the big rubber ball,
looking at Flossie meanwhile.</p>

<p>“Oh, just one more turn for me!” Flossie
begged, jumping up and down faster than
ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right! Let her have it!” agreed
Freddie, good-naturedly. “I’ll wait.”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of you,” said Nan. “All
right, Flossie, you may have this next toss!
Get ready!”</p>

<p>“One more turn for me!” sang Flossie gaily.
“One more turn for me! Hurry up, Nan,
please!”</p>

<p>Flossie stopped her jumping-jack movements,
and with outstretched hands and shining
eyes awaited the ball, which Nan tossed
across an old flower bed. In the past summer
bright blossoms had made this part of
the garden very gay. But now, with winter
coming on, the flowers had been killed by
Jack Frost and the stalks were sear and
brown.</p>

<p>“I got it!” cried Flossie. But she spoke a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
moment too soon, for the ball just touched
the tips of her fingers, bounced off, and rolled
across the frozen ground of the flower garden
right to Freddie’s feet. He picked it up.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed Flossie. She had so
much wanted to catch the ball this last time,
but she had missed it.</p>

<p>“You muffed!” cried Freddie. He had
heard his older brother Bert speak like that
when, in a real ball game, some boy failed to
hold the ball. “You muffed it, Flossie!”</p>

<p>Then, seeing that there were tears in his
twin sister’s eyes, Freddie did a very manly
and generous thing.</p>

<p>“You can have another turn,” he said.
“Toss it to Flossie again, Nan. I don’t mind
waiting.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice of you, Freddie,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” cried Flossie, quickly
“squeezing back” her tears. “I’ll give you
some of my candy, Freddie!”</p>

<p>“Will you?” he exclaimed. “What kind is
it, Flossie?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t any kind yet, ’cause I haven’t got
it,” the little golden-haired girl explained as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Nan took the ball from her small brother and
got ready to throw it again. “But I mean,
when I do get some candy I’ll give you a
piece.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Freddie, somewhat disappointed.
“Well, anyhow, you can have another
turn to catch the ball.”</p>

<p>“Maybe if Nan should take us down town
now she would buy us some candy,” went on
Flossie, getting ready for this next attempt
to catch the rubber ball. “Then I could give
you some, Freddie.”</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Nan. “That’s a gentle
hint, I suppose, Flossie, for me to take you
after candy. But I’m afraid I can’t to-day.
Now get ready. If you miss the ball this
time it won’t be fair to make Freddie wait
any longer.”</p>

<p>“I’ll catch it this time!” cried Flossie, and
she did. Right in her hands she caught the
bouncing rubber, and then she threw it back
to Nan while Freddie got ready for his turns.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Flossie danced about, waiting
until the ball would again come to her. Flossie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
was a lively little girl—always dancing,
running, singing, or doing something. And
Freddie was about the same. In fact, the
Bobbsey twins were a lively set of youngsters.</p>

<p>Freddie had caught the ball four times and
Nan was getting ready to toss it to him for
the fifth when a whistle was heard around
the corner of the house.</p>

<p>“Here comes Bert!” cried Flossie, and she
darted off to meet her older brother. Bert
was Nan’s twin and these two were a few
years older than the smaller Bobbsey twins.</p>

<p>“Maybe Bert will want to play ball,” suggested
Freddie, as he caught the rubber
sphere for the fifth time, making a perfect
score for him.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” replied Nan.</p>

<p>But when Bert came whistling around the
corner of the house, Flossie holding him by
one hand, he seemed to have something else
in mind than playing toss-ball with his
smaller brother and sister.</p>

<p>“You can’t guess what I know!” he called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
swinging Flossie around in a circle by her
two hands, her feet flying off the ground.</p>

<p>“Have you got candy?” the little girl demanded,
when Bert had set her down.</p>

<p>“Candy? No!” he laughed. “But there’s
a new horse in our garage.”</p>

<p>“A horse in our garage!” cried Nan. “Do
you mean a runaway?”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t running away—he’s just
standing there,” Bert answered, with a grin.</p>

<p>“How did a horse get in our garage?” asked
Flossie.</p>

<p>“A man put it there,” Bert answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe you!” exclaimed Nan.</p>

<p>“A horse couldn’t get in our garage!”
added Freddie.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Bert wanted to know. “It’s
big enough—our garage is. And, anyhow, it
used to be a stable with horses in it before
daddy made it over for automobiles. Of
course a horse could be in our garage.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it could,” admitted Nan.
“But what’s the horse doing there?”</p>

<p>“Just standing still.”</p>

<p>“Is he eating?” Flossie wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Bert thought this over for a moment before
he answered:</p>

<p>“No, the horse isn’t eating.”</p>

<p>There was something in her brother’s voice
that made Nan look at him sharply. Then
she cried:</p>

<p>“Look here, Bert Bobbsey, there’s something
queer about this! What kind of a
horse is it?”</p>

<p>Before Bert could answer Freddie asked:</p>

<p>“Has the horse four legs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, it has four legs! I’m sure of
that for I just counted them!” and Bert
seemed so very positive on this point that
Nan didn’t know what to think.</p>

<p>“Come on and I’ll show you the horse if
you don’t believe me,” offered Bert, moving
off toward the garage.</p>

<p>All thoughts of keeping on with the ball
game were now forgotten by Flossie and
Freddie. They were eager to see the strange
horse in their father’s garage. Nan could
not imagine how the animal could have been
put there.</p>

<p>“But maybe one of the store wagons broke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
and they had to leave the horse in our garage
until they get the wagon fixed,” she
thought to herself.</p>

<p>Into the garage ran the Bobbsey twins,
Flossie and Freddie merrily laughing, Bert
with a queer look on his face, and Nan ready
for almost anything.</p>

<p>“Where’s the horse?” demanded Freddie,
entering first and looking around.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any horse,” added Flossie, who
had closely followed her small brother.</p>

<p>“There it is!” exclaimed Bert.</p>

<p>He pointed to a carpenter’s sawhorse in one
corner of the building.</p>

<p>For a moment the smaller children looked
at it in surprise. Then Freddie burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! A sawhorse! A sawhorse!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“But it has got four legs—one, two, three,
four!” counted Flossie. “Oh, isn’t it funny!
I thought you meant a real horse, Bert.”</p>

<p>“So did I!” said Freddie.</p>

<p>“And I did, too, for a little while,” admitted
Nan. “But pretty soon I thought it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
be a joke. And I don’t think it’s a very good
joke, either, Bert Bobbsey, so there!”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see you think of a better joke!”
laughed Nan’s twin brother. “Ha! Ha! I
had you all fooled! It’s a sawhorse, and you
all thought it was a real horse! Oh, ho!”</p>

<p>“I can get on the back of this sawhorse,”
announced Freddie. “Look at me!” He
ran toward the wooden thing.</p>

<p>“Don’t fall!” cautioned Nan. But this
Freddie almost did in climbing up on the
sawhorse, which was rather a high one. Bert
caught him just in time.</p>

<p>“How did it get here?” Freddie asked,
when he was seated on the back of the “animal.”</p>

<p>“The carpenters have been working here,
and they left it,” Bert explained. “When I
saw it I thought it would be a good joke to
make believe it was a real horse. And I
fooled all of you!”</p>

<p>Nan was going to say again that she had
not been fooled very much when Flossie,
looking out of the window, cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s snowing! It’s snowing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Is it? Really?” Freddie wanted to know.
“Are you fooling like Bert was with the sawhorse,
Flossie?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s really snowing!” the little girl
answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, hurray! I want to see it!” cried
Freddie, and he was in such a hurry to descend
from the back of the sawhorse that this
time he fell in real earnest. However, as
there was a pile of shavings on the floor, left
there by the carpenters, Freddie fell into
them and was not hurt at all. But he was
covered with the shavings.</p>

<p>However, Nan picked him up and brushed
him off, and then he ran to the window out of
which the others were looking.</p>

<p>“It really is snowing!” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Looks as if it would last, too,” added Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, can I have my sled out?” begged
Flossie.</p>

<p>“I want mine, too!” chimed in Freddie.
“Oh, I’m so glad it’s winter and we’re going
to have ice and snow! Come on, let’s go
sleigh-riding! Hurray!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be in such a rush,” advised Bert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
“There’ll have to be more snow than this before
you can use your sleds.”</p>

<p>“But quite a lot has fallen, and it’s still
snowing hard,” said Nan. “It must have
started soon after we came in here.”</p>

<p>The twins had been in the garage some little
time, laughing and talking about Bert’s
joke and playing on the carpenter’s sawhorse,
and in that period the ground had been
whitened with the flurry of flakes.</p>

<p>“I’m going out and see how deep it is,” announced
Freddie.</p>

<p>Before either Nan or Bert could stop him,
if they had wanted to, the little fellow went
to a side door of the garage and, opening this,
rushed out. But he did not go far.</p>

<p>Right at the door a new drain was being
put in. A large sewer pipe was set upright
in the ground. Work around it was not yet
finished, and that was why the side door had
been closed.</p>

<p>But Freddie opened it. Then he slipped
on the newly fallen snow and a moment later
disappeared down the drain pipe!</p>

<h3>A BROKEN WINDOW</h3>


<p>For a moment following Freddie’s accident
there was silence. Even the little fellow
himself was so frightened that he forgot to
cry out. But a second or two later he found
his voice and set up a series of yells.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Get me out! Help me,
Bert!” he begged.</p>

<p>“Oh, Freddie, you poor boy!” gasped Nan.</p>

<p>“Is he dead? Will we ever get him up?”
Flossie wanted to know, and she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! I’ll get him out! He can’t
fall any farther!” shouted Bert. “I’ll lift
him out in a minute! You’re all right, Freddie,”
he went on. “Don’t cry any more!”</p>

<p>“I am <em>not</em> all right!” wailed the little chap.
“I’m down in a pipe! How can I—be all—all
right—when I’m in a pipe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>He was crying and Flossie was sobbing.
Nan did not know what to do.</p>

<p>Bert, however, seemed to know what he
was about. He hurried to the edge of the
drain pipe, down which his small brother had
slipped, and began to consider the best way
to get Freddie out.</p>

<p>And while Bert is doing that I shall take
just a moment to tell my new readers something
about the four children. They were
first introduced to you in the book called
“The Bobbsey Twins,” and in that you read
about Mr. Richard Bobbsey and his wife,
Mary, who lived in the eastern city of Lakeport
on Lake Metoka. Mr. Bobbsey owned
a lumberyard there.</p>

<p>There were two sets of twins. Bert and
Nan were the older. They had dark brown
hair and brown eyes. Flossie and Freddie
had light hair and blue eyes. Thus the
Bobbsey twins were quite a contrast, and
when the four walked down the street together
more than one person turned to look
at them.</p>

<p>The children had good times and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
adventures. They went to the country, to
the seashore, and of course attended school.
Once they visited Snow Lodge and were
storm-bound. They had traveled on the
deep blue sea, gone out West, spent some time
in Cedar Camp, and had gone through some
exciting times at a county fair. They had
also camped out.</p>

<p>The book just before this one is called
“The Bobbsey Twins and Baby May,” and
tells how they found a strange little baby and
what happened to it.</p>

<p>Now winter was coming on again, and the
children counted on having more fun. Bert
had played his joke about the sawhorse, and
then had followed Freddie’s fall down the
drain pipe.</p>

<p>“Can you get him up?” asked Nan anxiously.</p>

<p>“Sure I can!” Bert answered. “You stand
over there, Nan, on the other side of him.
Reach down in the pipe and put your hand
under Freddie’s left arm.”</p>

<p>Nan did this while Bert did the same thing
on the other side. The drain pipe was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
as large as Freddie’s body. He had slid into
it feet first, and his hands were down at his
sides. The pipe was not large enough for
him to lift his hands over the edge, or he
might have pushed himself out.</p>

<p>But with Bert and Nan to lift him, he was
soon pulled from the drain, more vexed than
hurt. Though it was found later that he had
skinned one shin rather painfully.</p>

<p>“There you are!” cried Bert, as he and Nan
set their little brother on his feet out on the
snow-covered ground. “You are all right,
Freddie. And don’t go jumping down any
more pipes!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t jump down!” declared the little
fellow, with some indignation. “I slipped
in!”</p>

<p>“You went in so quick,” observed Flossie,
“it was as if the sawhorse kicked you in,
wasn’t it, Freddie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was,” he said, and then he laughed.
So did Bert and Nan. A moment later, however,
a look of pain passed over Freddie’s face
and he put one hand down on his left shin.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Nan asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“My leg hurts!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s broken,” suggested Flossie.</p>

<p>“How could I walk if my leg was broken?”
the little boy demanded, and he strutted
about, though he limped a little.</p>

<p>“Let me look,” suggested Bert, and when
he had pulled down Freddie’s stocking they
all saw that the shin had been skinned and
was bleeding slightly. It had been scraped
on the edge of the drain pipe.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Flossie. “He’s got the
nose bleed on his leg!”</p>

<p>Freddie had been going to cry at the sight
of the blood. But when Flossie said this in
such a funny way he laughed, and so did
Bert and Nan.</p>

<p>“We’d better take him in the house and fix
his leg,” said Bert to his twin.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Nan agreed.</p>

<p>“Can’t I go sleigh-riding?” Freddie wanted
to know. “Look how nice it’s snowing!”</p>

<p>The white flakes were, indeed, swirling
down faster than ever. For the first snow of
the season, it was quite a storm, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
ground was now covered with the soft flakes.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, what has happened?” cried
Mrs. Bobbsey, when she saw Freddie, covered
with snow, limping toward the house, escorted
by Nan, Bert and Flossie.</p>

<p>“I—I fell in a pipe!” Freddie answered.</p>

<p>“A <em>pipe</em>? What sort of game were you
playing?” his mother wanted to know.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a game,” said Bert, and then he
explained.</p>

<p>Freddie’s leg felt better after his mother
had bandaged it with some soothing salve,
and then he was allowed to go out and play
in the snow on his sled with Flossie.</p>

<p>Bert had thought the snow would not
amount to much, but a little later he, too,
got out his sled.</p>

<p>Nan did likewise, and the Bobbsey twins
and some of their friends had a jolly time on
a little coasting hill not far from the house.</p>

<p>“Winter’s come pretty early this year,”
said Charlie Mason, one of Bert’s chums, as
the two boys went down the hill together,
bobsled fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bert. “We’ll have a lot of
fun at school to-morrow, making a snow fort.
That is, if the snow doesn’t melt.”</p>

<p>But there was plenty of snow on the
ground when the children awakened the next
morning, though the storm had stopped and
the sun was shining.</p>

<p>“I hope the sun doesn’t melt all the snow,”
sighed Flossie, as she got ready to accompany
her twin brother to school. They were
in a lower class than Bert and Nan, but the
smaller twins generally walked along with the
older brother or sister.</p>

<p>It was when the Bobbsey twins were almost
at school that John Marsh, a boy of
about Bert’s age, came running around the
corner of the street. John seemed rather out
of breath and excited.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, that Danny Rugg and Sam Todd are
pegging snowballs at me,” said John. “I
wouldn’t mind soft ones, but they’re using
hard balls. And they’re two to one—Sam
and Danny both pegged at me.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t fair!” cried Bert. “They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
ought to fight square—even on both sides—and
with soft balls. Come on, I’ll help
you!”</p>

<p>Together the two lads went back and
around the corner to the street where Danny
and his rather mischievous crony were standing,
leaving Nan to go with Flossie and Freddie
on to school.</p>

<p>“Hi! There’s John again!” yelled Sam
Todd, as he caught sight of the boy who had
run away.</p>

<p>“Soak him!” shouted Danny Rugg.</p>

<p>But a moment later the two little bullies,
for that is what they were, caught sight of
Bert Bobbsey with John and the hands they
had raised to throw the hard snowballs fell
back at their sides.</p>

<p>“Hello, Danny!” called Bert, for they were
on somewhat friendly terms.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Danny, not very cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Do you want to snowball fight?” demanded
Sam Todd.</p>

<p>“No, not now,” Bert answered. “But, anyhow,
when you do fight you ought to use soft
balls, and not two of you fellows go for one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“We didn’t use hard balls!” Danny declared.</p>

<p>“You did so!” cried John. “And you both
pegged at me at once!”</p>

<p>“Aw, well, it was only in fun,” grumbled
Danny. Now that Bert had joined John the
odds were against the bullies, for Sam Todd
was not a very large lad. “We’ll fight you
after school if you like,” went on Danny.
“Hard balls or soft balls, and the same number
on each side.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll lick you, too!” boasted Sam.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that!” laughed Bert. “I
don’t know if I want a snowball fight or not.
But I’m not going to throw any now, I know
that. It’s too near the school,” for the boys
had been walking along as they talked.</p>

<p>“We aren’t within a block yet,” declared
Danny. “It’s only against the rule to throw
snowballs within a block of the school,” and
he rounded in his hands a ball he had been
making.</p>

<p>“I’m not scared to throw one now,” declared
Sam, and he tossed a ball at a signboard,
hitting it a resounding whack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Neither am I!” exclaimed Danny, and he
also threw. As he did so Bert and John saw
something on Danny’s finger gleaming golden
in the sun. The flash seemed to remind
Danny of an important matter, for he held
up his right hand and cried: “Look at that!
Isn’t that a peach? It’s a new gold ring I
got for my birthday.”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky,” remarked Bert, as Danny
held the ring out to be admired.</p>

<p>“I guess I am,” boasted Danny. “No fellow
in our school has a valuable gold ring like
that! My father gave it to me.”</p>

<p>“I should think you wouldn’t like to wear
it for fear you might lose it,” remarked John.</p>

<p>“Naw, I won’t lose it,” drawled Danny.
“Go on, Bert!” he cried. “I dare you to
throw a snowball at the signboard. You
can’t throw as straight as I did!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can!” said Bert, who did not like
this said of him.</p>

<p>“Go on! Let’s see you!” cried Sam Todd.</p>

<p>As the lads were still more than a block
away from the school, they could, without
breaking the rule, throw snowballs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Accordingly, Bert and John tossed a few,
and Bert made much better shots than did
either Danny or Sam, though John did not do
so well.</p>

<p>“That’s because I ran and got out of
breath when you two were pegging hard balls
at me,” he said to the two bullies.</p>

<p>“Aw, we were only in fun,” Danny said.</p>

<p>“Two to one isn’t fair, though,” cried Bert.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re two now—do you want to
fight?” asked Sam, who seemed eager for a
battle in the snow.</p>

<p>Before Bert or John could answer the
clanging of a bell sounded on the clear, frosty
air, and Nan Bobbsey, who came through a
side street with Flossie and Freddie, cried:</p>

<p>“That’s the next to the last bell! You’d
better hurry if you don’t want to be late,
Bert!”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m hurrying,” he said.</p>

<p>Even Danny Rugg, bold as he sometimes
was, did not seem inclined to break the school
rule and throw balls within the block limit
set by Mr. Tarton, the principal. However,
he still held one of the white missiles in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
hand. This he tossed up and down, catching
it before it had time to reach the ground.
Danny’s new, gold birthday ring sparkled in
the sun.</p>

<p>“Let me wear that ring of yours sometime,
will you, Danny?” asked Sam, as he walked
on beside his crony.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“And if Bert and his crowd want to have a
snowball fight after school,” went on Sam in a
low voice, “I know where I can find a lot of
horse-chestnuts.”</p>

<p>“What good’ll horse-chestnuts be in a
snowball fight?” Danny wanted to know.</p>

<p>Sam looked around to make sure no one
would hear him, then he said:</p>

<p>“We can put a horse-chestnut inside a soft
snowball and make it sting like anything
when it hits! I can get a lot of ’em. Shall
I?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Danny. He was a bully,
but not quite as mischievous as was Sam.</p>

<p>On toward the school hurried the boys and
girls. The echoes of the next to the last bell
were ringing in their ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Better get rid of our snowballs, I guess,”
said Bert to John, as they crossed the street
which would put them within one block of
the school. “Mr. Tarton might see us.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed John. “Chuck your
balls away, fellows!” he called. “We’re
within a block.” He got rid of his own
sphere of snow and Bert tossed his to one
side. Several of the other boys who were
near did likewise.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, there was a crash of glass
and the pupils looking up in startled amazement,
saw that a snowball had gone through
one of the beautiful stained-glass windows in
a church near the school. A large piece was
broken out from the window picture.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” yelled many voices.</p>

<p>“Who broke the window?” cried the girls
and boys.</p>

<p>Then, as the last bell began to ring, they all
began to run so they would not be late.</p>

<h3>THE LOST RING</h3>


<p>Into the lower halls and corridors of the
school poured the children. The last bell
was still clanging, and they would not be
marked late if they reached their classrooms
before the last peal. The bell would ring for
several minutes yet.</p>

<p>On all sides, as the boys and girls hurried
in, could be heard talks and gasps of astonishment,
not unmixed with fear, about the
breaking of the church window.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you see it?”</p>

<p>“Did you hear it?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it make a big crash!”</p>

<p>“What’ll the church people say?”</p>

<p>“I guess that window must ’a’ cost a thousand
dollars!”</p>

<p>“Who did it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>This last question was the one most often
asked.</p>

<p>But no one seemed to know, or, if any one
did, he or she was not telling about it. Nan
hurried with Flossie and Freddie to their
classroom, and then she hastened back
toward her own. Bert was in Nan’s room,
and, seeing her brother just before she entered
the door, Nan whispered:</p>

<p>“Bert, did you break the church window?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, “I didn’t. Of course
I didn’t do it!”</p>

<p>“Do you know who did it?”</p>

<p>Bert did not answer for a second or two.
For the moment he and Nan were by themselves,
just outside their classroom door.
Then Bert looked down the corridor and saw
Danny Rugg and Sam Todd coming along.</p>

<p>“Do you know who did it?” repeated Nan.</p>

<p>“Maybe I do,” Bert answered slowly.
“And maybe I don’t,” he added, as Nan gave
a gasp of surprise. “Anyhow, I’m not going
to tell.”</p>

<p>That was all there was time to say. The
last bell was giving its final strokes, and Bert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and his sister hurried to their seats. Danny
and Sam, with other boys and girls, also
hastened in to their room; and then came
silence, for they were not, of course, allowed
to whisper in class.</p>

<p>The pupils had been sitting quietly a minute
or two when an electric bell in the room
rang. This was the signal for the children
to march to the big assembly hall where the
morning exercises were held.</p>

<p>“Attention!” called Miss Skell, who taught
Bert and Nan. “Rise! Turn! March!”</p>

<p>There was the tramping of a hundred feet
and the children were on their way to the
auditorium.</p>

<p>It was at the close of the exercises, after
the Bible reading and the singing of patriotic
songs, that the principal, Mr. James Tarton,
stepped to the edge of the platform and said:</p>

<p>“Boys and girls, I have an unpleasant announcement
to make. I am very sorry to
have to speak of it. But an accident happened
this morning. Perhaps some of you
may know what it was.”</p>

<p>By the gasps and murmurs that ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
through the room it was easy to tell that a
number of the pupils knew about what the
principal was going to speak.</p>

<p>“Some one—a boy I think it must have
been, for I doubt if a girl could throw so hard
and straight. Some boy broke the rule about
snowballing within a block of the school,”
went on Mr. Tarton, “and threw a ball, or a
chunk of ice, against one of the stained-glass
windows of the church. The window was
broken, and of course must be paid for. It
is only right that the boy who broke it should
pay for it. Now I am going to ask the boy
who threw the snowball against the church
window to be man enough to stand up and
admit it. He will not be punished if he
frankly confesses, but of course he or his
father will have to pay for the broken glass.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tarton stopped speaking and waited.
It grew very still and quiet in the room. If
any one had dropped a pin it could have been
heard in the farthest corner. But no one
dropped a pin. Nor did any one speak.
Nor did any boy stand up to say he had
broken the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The silence continued. The teachers, sitting
in a row back of Mr. Tarton on the platform,
looked at the faces of the boys and
girls in front of them.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the principal in a low voice,
“I am waiting.”</p>

<p>Still no one got up. Some of the boys and
girls began to shift uneasily in their seats and
shuffled their feet. They were getting what
an older person would call “nervous.”</p>

<p>“It does not seem,” went on Mr. Tarton,
“that the boy who broke the window is going
to be man enough to own up to it. I dislike
to do this, but I must ask if any one here
knows anything about it. I mean did any
of you see any one throw a snowball at the
church window?”</p>

<p>There was a further silence, but only for a
few seconds. Then up went the hand of Sam
Todd. Some of the girls gasped loudly,
seeming to guess what was coming next.</p>

<p>“Well, Sammie,” said Mr. Tarton kindly,
“what do you know about breaking the
church window? Did you do it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Do you know who did?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>More gasps of surprise.</p>

<p>“Who broke the window?” asked the principal.</p>

<p>“Bert Bobbsey!” said Sam in a firm voice,
and Nan was so excited that she cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Nor did the principal or any of the teachers
scold her. But Bert was not one to sit
quietly and be falsely accused. In an instant
he was on his feet, raising his hand that he
might get permission to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, Bert,” said Mr. Tarton quietly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t break that window!” cried the
Bobbsey lad. “I didn’t even throw a snowball
toward it. I didn’t do it at all!” His
face was very red.</p>

<p>“Sammie, did you actually see Bert Bobbsey
throw a snowball at the stained-glass
window and break it?” asked Mr. Tarton,
and his voice was stern.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t really see him break the
window,” Sam replied. “But I saw a snowball<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
in his hand. I saw him raise his hand
to throw the snowball, and right after that I
heard the glass crack. Bert Bobbsey did it!”</p>

<p>“I did not!” exclaimed Bert.</p>

<p>“Quiet! That will do!” the principal
called, raising his hand for silence. “We will
not go further into the matter here. Bert,
come to my office after school, and you also,
Sam. We will talk about the broken window
then. The classes will now go to their own
rooms.”</p>

<p>The teacher at the piano began to play a
lively march, but there was not much spring
in the steps of Bert and Nan Bobbsey as they
filed back to Miss Skell’s room. Bert was hurt
and indignant that Sam should accuse him
of breaking the window. Nan, too, felt sure
that her brother had not done it.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him scare you, Bert!” whispered
Charlie Mason, one of Bert’s best chums, to
the Bobbsey lad in the corridor. “We know
you didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>Of course it was against the rule for Charlie
to whisper thus in the hall, but he was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
caught at it. Bert was glad his chum had
spoken to him.</p>

<p>“Now, children,” said Miss Skell, when her
pupils were again in their seats, “we are going
to forget all about the broken church window.
Mr. Tarton will attend to that. And please
forget that Bert has been mentioned as doing
it.</p>

<p>“I, for one,” and Miss Skell smiled down
at the blushing Bobbsey boy, “don’t believe
Bert would do such a thing. I think Sammie
must be mistaken. Now we shall go on
with our lessons.”</p>

<p>Neither Danny nor Sam were in the room
with Bert and Nan, and for this the two
Bobbseys were glad. Sam and his crony
were in the same grade with Bert and Nan,
but, because of its size, the class recited in
two different rooms under separate teachers.</p>

<p>It took a little time for the class to quiet
down after the unusual excitement, but at
length the recitations were proceeded with.</p>

<p>It was when Bert and Nan were hurrying
home at the noon recess with Flossie and
Freddie that Nan said to her brother:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“Who broke that window, Bert? If you
know you ought to tell, especially since they
say you did it.”</p>

<p>“Nobody says I did it except that sneak,
Sam Todd, and he isn’t telling the truth!” exclaimed
her twin.</p>

<p>“Do you know who did it?” persisted Nan.
Flossie and Freddie had run on a little way
ahead to play with children from their own
class, and did not hear what the two older
Bobbseys were saying.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” answered Bert, looking
about to make certain no one was near
enough to catch what he said, “I didn’t actually
see him throw the snowball, but I believe
Danny Rugg broke that window.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, do you, really?” gasped Nan.</p>

<p>“I sure do! I can’t prove it, for I didn’t
see him. But he had a snowball in his hand
and he chucked it away when he was near the
church. And right after that the window
broke. But I’m not going to tell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, maybe you ought to! Do you
remember the time Mr. Ringley’s shoe store
window was broken?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bert, “I remember that
time.”</p>

<p>“They said you did that,” went on Nan.
“But afterward old Mr. Roscoe said he saw
Danny Rugg throw the chunk of ice that
broke the window. And when Danny found
out Mr. Roscoe had seen him, then Danny
owned up that he did it. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he broke Mr. Ringley’s window,” admitted
Bert, speaking of something that happened
in the first book of this series, “The
Bobbsey Twins.” In that volume you meet
Danny Rugg as a bad boy, who was very unfriendly
toward Nan and Bert. Then, after
a fight, Danny seemed to have reformed, and
he became a better boy.</p>

<p>“He’s as bad as ever—breaking windows
and things like that!” went on Nan.</p>

<p>“We don’t know for sure that he did it,”
cautioned Bert.</p>

<p>“It would be just like him to do it!” declared
Nan. “Are you going to tell mother?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>And when Mrs. Bobbsey heard what had
happened she advised Bert to speak nothing
but the truth and not to accuse Danny unless
he was sure that lad had broken the window.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” sighed Bert. “I can’t
be sure, but I feel pretty certain that Danny
did it.”</p>

<p>“It will all come out right,” his mother
told him. “And of course you must not
say that you broke the window if you didn’t.
Mr. Tarton is too fair a man to let you be
accused without good proof.”</p>

<p>And it was not very good proof that Sam
Todd could give when later in the day he and
Bert went to the principal’s office. Sam told
his story over again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bert admitted, “I did have some
snowballs in my hand. Danny Rugg and
Sam had been throwing at John Marsh, and
he ran to where I was. I was going to help
John fight, but there wasn’t any need. And
I tossed away my snowballs before I got
within a block of the school.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Sam. “And I think I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
saw you throw yours at the church window,
Bert. Maybe you didn’t mean to break it,
but you did.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t!” insisted Bert stoutly.</p>

<p>“I think we had better have Danny Rugg
in here to see what he knows about it,” suggested
Mr. Tarton. “It would not be fair to
punish Bert on just your say-so, Sammie.
You might be honestly mistaken. Go out
and see if you can find Danny and bring him
in here.”</p>

<p>But there was no need to go after Danny
Rugg. Just as Sam was leaving the principal’s
office Danny came hurrying in, much excited.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, Mr. Tarton!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the head of the school.
And Bert found himself wondering whether
Danny was going to confess having broken
the stained-glass window of the church.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Tarton!” gasped Danny. “I’ve
lost my gold ring! My birthday ring is
gone!” and he held up his hand. No longer
did the gold band glitter on it.</p>

<h3>BAD NEWS</h3>


<p>Mr. Tarton had not been principal of the
Lakeport school a number of years without
knowing how to deal with the boys and girls.</p>

<p>He was used to all kinds of excitement,
having girls fall downstairs and stopping
boys from fighting. And often the pupils
lost things in school. So the news that
Danny had lost his ring did not startle Mr.
Tarton very much.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s too bad, Danny,” said the
principal. “I’m sorry about your ring. I’ll
announce before the school to-morrow that
you have lost it, and perhaps some one has
found it. What kind of ring was it?”</p>

<p>“A birthday ring.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But was it gold or silver
and did it have a stone in it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“It was gold, and all carved. It didn’t
have any stone in it, but on top it had the letters
of my name—D. R. For Danny Rugg,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” returned the principal,
while Bert looked at Danny and Sam rather
soberly. For Bert did not like being accused
of having broken the window when he had
not even thrown at it, and he thought Danny
should be man enough to own up that he did
it.</p>

<p>“I was just going to send for you, Danny,
to ask you about the broken church window,”
the principal went on. “But finish telling me
about your ring, so I will know what to say
when school starts to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, I had my ring on when I came to
school this morning,” Danny said. “And
just now, when I was going home—I was
waiting outside for Sam,” he explained.
“Just now I saw it wasn’t on my finger. I
went back in my classroom to look for it, but
it wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>“Very likely you dropped it somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
around the school,” said Mr. Tarton. “I will
inquire about it. But now as to this broken
window. Sam says he thinks Bert did it.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t!” burst out Bert Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, please, Bert,” said Mr.
Tarton, in a low voice. “Did you see Bert
break the window, Danny?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I—now—I didn’t exactly see him
break it,” answered Danny slowly. “But I
saw him have a snowball in his hand.”</p>

<p>“You had one yourself!” cried Bert. “And
so did Sam!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t throw it at the church, though!”
Sam cried.</p>

<p>“Neither did I!” declared Bert.</p>

<p>Danny said nothing, but he did not look at
Bert.</p>

<p>The principal questioned the boys for a
long time, but he could learn nothing more.
Sam stuck to it that Bert had broken the
window, and though Danny did not actually
say so, it was easy to see that he wanted
Sam’s story to be believed. And of course
Bert said he did not break the stained glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Bert, do you know who broke the
window?” asked Mr. Tarton, at last.</p>

<p>For a moment the Bobbsey boy was silent.
Then in a low voice he said:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I think I know who did it. But
I’m not going to tell.”</p>

<p>Danny Rugg’s face grew rather red at this,
and he seemed very much interested in looking
at something outside the window.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Tarton, at length, “I can’t
make you tell, Bert, and I don’t know that I
want to. I hope that the boy who broke the
window will be man enough to confess and
pay for it. Meanwhile, we shall let the matter
rest. You boys may go.”</p>

<p>Danny and Sam hurried out ahead of Bert,
who walked more slowly. Since morning
many things had happened, and Bert no
longer felt as friendly toward Danny as he
had before.</p>

<p>“Danny’s a whole lot meaner since he got
so thick with Sam Todd,” said Bert to himself,
as he walked out of the school. He
could hear the two cronies talking together
just ahead of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“Did you really lose your gold birthday
ring, Dan?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Sure I did!” was the answer. “Dad’ll
scold me, too, when he finds it out. I wish I
could get it back.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know where you lost it?” Sam
wanted to know.</p>

<p>What Danny answered Bert could not hear,
for by this time the two boys had run on
ahead. They were making snowballs and
throwing them.</p>

<p>“Trying to break more windows, I guess,”
murmured Bert, as he passed the church and
looked up at the hole in the beautiful stained-glass
window. Then he saw a man’s head
thrust out of the hole—for it was large
enough for that, and Bert recognized the
church sexton, Robert Shull. Mr. Shull was
about to fasten a piece of plain glass over the
hole in the colored window.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bert!” called Mr. Shull, for the
Bobbseys attended this church and the sexton
knew the twins.</p>

<p>“Hello!” Bert answered.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to mend this hole to keep out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
snow until this window can be fixed with new
stained glass,” the sexton said. “It’s going
to cost quite a lot of money, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so,” agreed Bert.</p>

<p>“Some of you boys broke this,” the sexton
went on, his head still out of the hole. He
was picking from the window frame small
bits of broken glass that had not fallen when
the snowball crashed through.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess one of our fellows did it,” admitted
Bert.</p>

<p>“I heard it was you,” went on Mr. Shull.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t!” Bert cried.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe you did. You aren’t
that kind of a boy. Maybe you know who
did it?” Mr. Shull seemed to be asking a
question.</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe I do,” Bert admitted. But
that was all he would say. He walked on
toward home.</p>

<p>When Bert reached his corner and was
about to turn down the street on which he
lived, he saw Danny and Sam throwing snowballs
at a signboard. The two cronies caught
sight of him and Danny called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“Want to get up a snowball fight, Bert
Bobbsey?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t!” was the answer, not very
pleasantly given.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of being licked!” taunted Sam.</p>

<p>“I am not!” cried Bert. “I’ll snowball
fight you any time I feel like it, Sam Todd,
but I don’t feel like it. And you needn’t go
around saying I broke that church window,
for I didn’t!”</p>

<p>“It looked just like you did it,” Sam
said, not quite so sure of himself as he had
been.</p>

<p>“Aw, stop talking about it,” advised Danny
Rugg. “And say, Bert, if you find my gold
ring I’ll give you a reward.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Bert in a low voice,
and passed on. He did not feel much like
talking to Danny and Sam.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you twenty-five cents!” Danny
called after him. But Bert did not turn his
head or answer.</p>

<p>On reaching home, Nan told her mother
why Bert had been kept in. Mrs. Bobbsey
felt sorry for her son, but she knew he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
not broken the window, and she felt sure that
in time the truth would be known.</p>

<p>So when Bert finally reached home, half an
hour later than usual, he found his mother
waiting for him. She asked him what had
happened, and Bert told her.</p>

<p>“Do you really think Danny did it?” asked
Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“I’m almost sure of it,” Bert answered.
“If I could only prove it I’d be glad, for then
everybody would know I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” soothed his mother. “Perhaps,
some day, you can find a way of making
sure that Danny did it. Then your name
will be cleared. But until you are sure, don’t
say that Danny broke the window.”</p>

<p>“No, Mother, I won’t,” promised Bert.</p>

<p>“Did you say Danny lost his new birthday
ring?” went on Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“Yes and he was all excited about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course it’s too bad,” said Bert’s
mother. “But he shouldn’t have worn a valuable
ring to school—especially at snowballing
time. Things lost in the snow are hard to
find.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Bert went out to play in the snow with his
brother and sisters. He looked up at the evening
sky and saw it covered with clouds.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be more snow,” Bert decided.
“If a lot falls we can coast on the big
hill, and we can make snow forts and snow
men and everything!”</p>

<p>Bert, like the other Bobbsey twins, liked
the fun that came with winter. He liked
summer fun, also. In fact, Bert and the
other three Bobbsey twins liked all kinds of
fun, just as you and I do.</p>

<p>It was after the evening meal, when Mr.
Bobbsey was telling Bert not to mind so
much being accused of breaking the church
window, that the doorbell rang. Dinah, the
colored cook, big, fat and jolly, answered and
came back with a yellow envelope in her
hand.</p>

<p>“A telegram!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“I hope it isn’t any bad news!”</p>

<p>Every one grew quiet while Mr. Bobbsey
opened the message.</p>

<p>“Well, it is bad news—of a sort,” he said.</p>

<p>“What?” asked his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“Uncle Rossiter is very ill,” answered Mr.
Bobbsey. “He wants you and me, Mary, to
come to him at once. I think we’ll have to
go. It may be his last illness. We’d better
start in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you take us with you?” begged
Nan. “I remember Uncle Rossiter. Can’t
we go with you?”</p>

<p>“Take us! Take us!” begged Flossie and
Freddie.</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered slowly, “it would be
out of the question to take you twins. You’ll
have to stay at home and keep house by yourselves.
Mother and I will need to leave in a
hurry. We can’t take you.”</p>

<p>Sad looks were on the faces of all the Bobbsey
twins.</p>

<h3>AUNT SALLIE PRY</h3>


<p>Mr. Bobbsey got out some railroad time-tables
and began looking at them, trying to
decide how early he and his wife must leave
the next day to get to Uncle Rossiter’s home,
which was several hundred miles away.</p>

<p>“Is Uncle Rossiter very sick?” asked Bert
of his mother, who was again reading the telegram
that had arrived.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he is,” was the answer. “Poor
old man! He is all alone in the world.
Your father and I are the only relations he
has left, so that’s why he wants to see us.”</p>

<p>“I do wish we could go with you,” sighed
Bert.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t want to quit school, would
you?” asked his father, looking up from the
time-tables.</p>

<p>“School isn’t so nice when a lot of fellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
in it think you broke a window,” grumbled
Bert.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” laughed Mr. Bobbsey. “You
know you didn’t do it. We know you didn’t
do it, and so do your friends. The others
don’t matter. And in time it will be found
out who really smashed the glass.”</p>

<p>“But if you and mother are going away
and leave us here all alone, it won’t be any
fun,” said Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think it will!” cried Nan. “We can
keep house by ourselves. I love to cook and
wash the dishes.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be alone,” Mrs. Bobbsey said.
“Dinah will be here to cook and look after
you. Sam will shovel the snow, if any more
falls, and he’ll look after the fires. You’ll be
all right with Sam and Dinah.”</p>

<p>Sam Johnson was Dinah’s husband, and
though he was not as fat as was she, he was
quite as good-natured and jolly.</p>

<p>“Besides,” went on Mrs. Bobbsey, “I will
ask a woman to come in to help you keep
house, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Who, Mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll send for Mrs. Pry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Sallie!” exclaimed Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Sallie,” his mother answered.
“She is a very good housekeeper and will look
after you very well. She is a little deaf, it’s
true, but if you speak a little louder than
usual and quite plainly, she will hear you.
Flossie and Freddie aren’t going to mind
staying at home and keeping house while
daddy and mother are gone, are you?” and
she looked at the smaller twins.</p>

<p>“I like to keep house,” said blue-eyed Flossie.
“I’ll help Nan wash the dishes.”</p>

<p>“I like Aunt Sallie,” said Freddie. “She
makes nice cookies, and maybe she’ll tell us
stories.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be fun!” cried Flossie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pry was an elderly lady who went
about doing housework, and Mrs. Bobbsey
had engaged her on other occasions when it
was necessary for her to leave home for a
time.</p>

<p>“I won’t worry about the children when
Aunt Sallie is with them,” Mrs. Bobbsey said.
“And now, if we are to leave early in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
morning, Dick,” she said to her husband, “we
had better begin packing now. You do that
and I’ll telephone to the boarding house
where Mrs. Pry lives and leave word for her
to come early to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Then began a busy time in the Bobbsey
house.</p>

<p>“My, what a lot of things have happened
since yesterday!” said Nan a little later when
she was helping her mother put Flossie and
Freddie to bed. “Freddie fell down a drain
pipe, it snowed, the church window was
broken, and now you’re going away,
Mother!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but daddy and I won’t be gone
any longer than we need be, my dear. And
I know you will help Dinah and Aunt Sallie
keep house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll help—I love to!” answered
Nan.</p>

<p>After the first shock of it was over and Bert
and Nan had passed the disappointment of
not being allowed to make the journey with
their father and mother, the older Bobbsey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
twins rather began to like the idea of keeping
house.</p>

<p>“I guess Aunt Sallie will give me all the
cookies I want,” thought Freddie, as he went
to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey remained up later,
to pack in readiness for the early morning
start. Word came from Mrs. Pry that she
would come as soon as she could.</p>

<p>“Now, doan you all worry, Miz Bobbsey,”
said Dinah to the children’s mother when the
taxicab came to take the travelers to the railroad
station. “Sam an’ me we’ll look after
de chilluns jes’ same’s if you all was heah!”</p>

<p>“I know you will, Dinah,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Now, you be good children, won’t
you?” she asked, kissing them all again.</p>

<p>“We will,” promised Nan.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a snow man!” declared
Freddie.</p>

<p>“An’ I’m going to make a snow lady,” said
Flossie.</p>

<p>“I’ll write you a letter,” promised Bert,
“and let you know everything is all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Son, do that,” begged his father.
“And if it is found out who broke the window,
put that in your letter.”</p>

<p>Bert promised he would do this. More
good-byes were said, Mrs. Bobbsey kissed the
children for the third time all around, and
then, trying not to let them see that her eyes
were shining with unshed tears, she ran out
to the taxicab, followed by her husband.</p>

<p>“Doan you worry now!” were Dinah’s
parting words. “Everyt’ing am gwine to be
all right!”</p>

<p>But little did Dinah, nor any of the others,
know what was going to happen when the
Bobbsey twins began keeping house.</p>

<p>So early had breakfast been served that
morning, in order that Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey
could take the train, that it was not
yet time for school. So Bert went out to
the garage where Sam Johnson was at work,
for Bert wanted to fix something on his
sled.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s going to snow more,” Bert
said, looking up at the clouded sky, “and I
want my clipper in shape for the big hill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Sam, “I shouldn’t wonder
myse’f but whut we’d hab mo’ snow. Feels
mighty like it! Come in, Bert, an’ shut de
do’,” he added, for Bert was standing in the
garage with the door partly open as he
scanned the sky.</p>

<p>“If it’s going to storm,” said the boy, as he
got out his sled to mend one of the runners
that was loose, “I hope it doesn’t get too bad
before dad and mother reach Uncle Rossiter’s.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Sam. “’Twouldn’t be no
fun to hab dem snowed in—fo’ a fac’ it
wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>Nan wanted to help Dinah wash the dishes,
as she said she had time before school. But
the fat, good-natured cook chuckled and said:</p>

<p>“Nebber mind, honey lamb. I got loads
ob time. You jes’ see dat mah odder two
sweethearts am ready fo’ school, bress dere
hearts!” She meant Freddie and Flossie.</p>

<p>So Nan looked after the younger twins and
then, as the hands of the clock pointed toward
half past eight, the Bobbsey twins—all of
them—went to their classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“But what about Aunt Sallie Pry?” asked
Bert of Nan. “I thought she was coming to
keep house for us.”</p>

<p>“I guess she’ll be at the house when we
come home to lunch,” Nan said.</p>

<p>That morning, before the assembled classes,
Mr. Tarton mentioned Danny Rugg’s
lost birthday ring, speaking about the gold
initials on top.</p>

<p>“If any of you children find Danny’s ring,”
went on the school head, “either give it to
him or bring it to my office.”</p>

<p>Danny Rugg raised his hand for permission
to speak.</p>

<p>“What is it, Danny?” asked the principal,
while the whole school wondered what was
coming next. Bert Bobbsey had a wild idea
in his head.</p>

<p>“Maybe Danny’s going to confess that he
broke the window,” said the Bobbsey boy to
himself.</p>

<p>But what Danny said was:</p>

<p>“I’ll give twenty-five cents to whoever finds
my lost ring.”</p>

<p>Some of the teachers laughed a little at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
this, and even Mr. Tarton smiled, but he
said:</p>

<p>“All right, Danny. You have heard the
offer of the reward,” he went on to the school.
“And now about another matter. Yesterday
it was said here that Bert Bobbsey broke the
church window. I want to say that there is
no proof of this. Bert says he did not do it,
and we are bound to believe him.</p>

<p>“I do hope that whoever broke the stained
glass will be manly enough to admit it, and
pay for the damage to the church. I have
heard from Mr. Shull, the sexton, that it will
cost about ten dollars to repair the window.”</p>

<p>Several of the children gasped at this. To
most of them ten dollars was a great deal of
money. And Bert thought Danny looked a
trifle pale on hearing this news.</p>

<p>But nothing more was said about the broken
window, and the classes marched to their
several rooms and the school day went on.</p>

<p>Hurrying home at noon, the Bobbsey twins
were rather surprised to find that Aunt Sallie
Pry had not yet arrived to help Dinah take
charge of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe she isn’t coming,” suggested Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she’s suah to come!” Dinah
stated. “Mrs. Pry, she done tellyfoam me
dat she’d be ober dis ebenin’.”</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?” Nan wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“She done say she got a li’l touch ob de misery
in her back,” Dinah explained.</p>

<p>“What’s misery?” Freddie wanted to know.</p>

<p>“A sort o’ pain,” Dinah told him. “Now
eat you lunch, honey lambs, so’s you kin git
to de head of de class when you goes back to
school.”</p>

<p>“I’m head of the class now, Dinah,” said
Freddie. “That is, I’m head of the boys.
Flossie is head of the girls’ side.”</p>

<p>“Aw right, honey lamb!” chuckled Dinah.
“Den you all had done bettah eat a good
lunch so’s you all kin stay at de head!”</p>

<p>Back to school went the Bobbsey twins,
and when the classes were out later in the
afternoon they hurried home again. As they
reached the house a few flakes of snow began
to fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Freddie. “More snow!
Hurray!”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” cried Flossie. “Oh, won’t we
have fun!”</p>

<p>The wind began to blow and the snow fell
more thickly.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be quite a storm,” said Bert.</p>

<p>“I wonder if mother and daddy won’t be
snowed in on the train?” said Nan. “Trains
do get snowed up, don’t they, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes they do, I guess,” he answered.
“But maybe mother and dad are at Uncle
Rossiter’s by this time.”</p>

<p>“No, they won’t get there until late to-night,”
Nan said. “It’s a long journey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe they won’t get snowed
in,” said Bert.</p>

<p>“I’m going to play with my sled!” cried
Flossie. Then she opened her mouth wide,
trying to catch snowflakes on her rosy tongue.</p>

<p>“So’m I!” added Freddie.</p>

<p>“Well, you may play out for a time,” said
Nan, acting the part of a “little mother.”
Then she told the two smaller twins to go in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and get on their rubber boots and old coats,
so if they fell down, as they often did when
playing, no damage would be done.</p>

<p>After some jolly fun out of doors the Bobbsey
twins entered the house by the side door
to get ready for the evening meal. As they
did so the bell at the front door rang.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s Aunt Sallie,” said Nan.
“She telephoned that she’d be here about this
time.”</p>

<p>“Is the misery in her back better?” asked
Freddie.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Nan answered as she went to
the door, followed by the two smaller twins.
And when Nan opened the door, there stood
Aunt Sallie, her bag in her hand, and the
snowflakes swirling around her.</p>

<p>“Well, my dears, here I am,” she announced.</p>

<p>“We’re glad you came,” said Nan politely.</p>

<p>“How’s your back?” asked Freddie.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried the old lady. “You
say the train ran off the track? Good gracious!
I hope your folks weren’t hurt! Oh,
dear!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed Nan, trying not to
laugh. “Freddie didn’t say anything about
the train running off the track. He asked
how was your back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my back! That’s a lot better, thank
goodness,” said the old lady, as she entered
the hall, shaking off the snowflakes.</p>

<p>Bert came out to greet the visitor, who was
to remain several days—until Mr. and Mrs.
Bobbsey returned—and said:</p>

<p>“It’s going to be quite a storm, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What’s that? You say your clothes are
torn?” cried the old lady. “Well, don’t
worry. I brought needles and thread with
me. I’ll soon mend your torn clothes.”</p>

<p>“No,” chuckled Bert, “I said it’s quite a
storm!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Storm! Yes, indeed!” murmured
Mrs. Pry. “I’m afraid I’m getting a little
deaf,” she went on. “You children will need
to talk a bit louder.”</p>

<p>“A lot louder, I’ll say,” murmured Bert to
himself.</p>

<h3>LOST TWINS</h3>


<p>Mrs. Pry was a “little deaf,” as she called
it. She also was a good-natured person.
And she was no stranger to the Bobbsey
twins. She had worked in their house many
times before, and knew her way about very
well.</p>

<p>“I suppose, Nan,” she said, “that I’m to
take the room I always have?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Sallie,” answered Nan, for Mrs.
Pry wanted to be called by the more affectionate
name. “Mother said your old room
was ready for you.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll just take my bag up and be right
down to help get supper,” and she started up
the stairs.</p>

<p>“I guess Dinah has everything all cooked,
ready to eat,” Nan said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you’re going to have boiled beets, are
you? That’s good! I’m very fond of boiled
beets,” and Mrs. Pry smiled and went on upstairs,
not knowing that she had misunderstood
Nan. But Nan did not take the
trouble then to correct the old lady. She had
all she could do, did Nan, to keep Flossie and
Freddie from laughing out loud at Mrs. Pry’s
queer mistakes.</p>

<p>Bert and Nan at first felt a trifle lonesome
because their father and mother had gone
away, but this feeling wore off as the evening
advanced. There was a jolly little
party at the table when the evening meal was
served, and Mrs. Pry made many more queer
mistakes because she did not catch just what
the children or Dinah said. And as the
Bobbsey twins were nearly always laughing,
anyhow, a few laughs, more or less, at Mrs.
Pry’s mistakes did not matter. She did not
know they were laughing at her, and, really, it
did no harm.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, you can’t help it,” said Bert to
Nan afterward. “I thought I’d burst right
out snickering when I asked her to pass the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
bread and she thought I was saying I couldn’t
move my head!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was funny,” agreed Nan. “Is it
still snowing, Bert?” she asked, as she got out
her books, ready to do some studying for the
next day.</p>

<p>“Yes, snowing hard,” Bert reported as he
held his hands to the sides of his face so he
could peer out into the darkness. “Going to
be a regular blizzard, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert! I hope not that!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because, I don’t want father and mother
snowed-up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess a train can get through pretty
big drifts before it’s stuck. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie had gone to bed earlier,
and about all they talked of was the fun they
would have in the snow the next day.</p>

<p>“If it snows too hard they ought not to go
to school,” said Nan to Bert, speaking of the
smaller twins.</p>

<p>“No, I guess it would be better for them to
stay at home with Aunt Sallie and Dinah—if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the snow’s too deep,” he agreed. “But maybe
it won’t be.”</p>

<p>Flossie slept in Nan’s room, while Freddie
“bunked,” as he called it, with Bert. Just
how long she had been asleep Nan did not
know, but she was awakened by hearing her
sister calling her.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, what is it?” asked Nan sleepily.</p>

<p>“I’d like a drink of water,” Flossie answered.</p>

<p>“All right,” Nan said kindly. She often
got up in the night to get Flossie a drink.
Now she slipped on her robe and slippers and
went into the bathroom. “It’s still snowing,”
said Nan to herself, as she listened to
the wind blowing the flakes against the window.
“I do hope mother and daddy will be
all right.”</p>

<p>Nan was carrying the water in to her sister
when the door of Aunt Sallie’s room, farther
down the hall, opened, and the old lady put
out her head. Nan noticed the old-fashioned
night-cap Mrs. Pry wore.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter, Nan?” asked Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Pry. “Has anything happened? Are burglars
trying to get in? If they are, telephone
for the police at once. Don’t try to fight
burglars by yourself.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t burglars,” answered Nan. “I was
just getting Flossie a drink.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed the old lady.
“You say Flossie has fallen into the sink?
Poor child! But what is she doing at the
sink this hour of the night?”</p>

<p>“Not sink—drink!” exclaimed Nan, trying
not to laugh. “I am getting Flossie a drink.”</p>

<p>“Oh—drink! Why didn’t you say so at
first, my dear? Well, I must get in bed or
I’ll have that misery in my back again.”</p>

<p>Flossie turned over and went to sleep once
more after taking the water. But Nan was
a bit longer finding her way to dreamland.
Somehow or other, she felt worried, just why
she could not say.</p>

<p>“But I feel as if something were going to
happen,” she told herself.</p>

<p>However, Nan was a strong, healthy girl,
and when you are that way you do not lie
awake very long at night. So Nan soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
dropped off to sleep and then the house remained
quiet until morning.</p>

<p>“Oh, it snowed a lot!” cried Flossie, running
to the window to look out.</p>

<p>“Get back into bed!” ordered Nan. “You’ll
catch cold in your bare feet. Is it still snowing,
Flossie?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t snowing but there’s a lot on
the ground.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad the storm is over,” said
Nan, as she got up to dress, after which she
would look after Flossie.</p>

<p>So much snow had fallen in and around
Lakeport that, though it was still early in the
season, it looked as if winter had come to
stay. Of course all the boys and girls liked
this, though when Sam Johnson went out to
shovel paths it can not be said that he liked
the snow.</p>

<p>“Makes too much wuk!” Sam said to his
wife.</p>

<p>“You ought to be glad you has yo’ health,
Sam!” chuckled fat Dinah. “An’ when you
comes in I’s gwine to hab hot pancakes an’
sausages an’ maple syrup fo’ you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Yum! Yum!” murmured Sam. “Dat’s
good!”</p>

<p>“Are we going to have pancakes, too?”
asked Freddie, overhearing this talk.</p>

<p>“Indeed you is, honey lamb!” said Dinah,
smiling at him.</p>

<p>On the way to school, Danny Rugg and
Sam Todd began throwing snowballs at Bert
and John Marsh. Bert did not mind this
much, since Danny and Sam were using soft
balls. But pretty soon Joe Norton, a chum
of Sam’s, happened along, and he joined
forces with Danny. This made three against
two, and Bert and John were getting the worst
of it when Charlie Mason, with whom Bert
was very friendly, ran up.</p>

<p>“Let me get a shot at ’em!” cried Charlie,
and he made snowballs so fast and threw
them so straight, hitting Danny, Sam and
Joe, that though the sides were even, Danny
and his two chums turned and ran away.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” taunted John. “You’re afraid
to stay and fight!”</p>

<p>“We are not,” said Danny. “But it’s almost
time for the last bell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“That’s a good excuse!” laughed Charlie.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some horse-chestnuts in my
pocket,” said Sam to Danny as they ran on.
“This afternoon we’ll put some inside snowballs
and we’ll soak Bert and his gang good
and hard.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Danny.</p>

<p>Though the snow had stopped falling, the
skies had not cleared and the storm did not
appear to be over, except for a little while.
And there was so much snow on the ground
that Mr. Tarton announced at the morning
exercises that the children of the primary
grades would be excused from returning in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I also want to add,” the principal went on,
“that we shall do this winter as we have done
in past years. If on any morning the weather
is too bad, or the storm too heavy, to make it
safe for you to come out, the bell will be
rung three times, five strokes each time, as a
signal that there is to be no school. Then
you need not start.</p>

<p>“So, children, in case of a storm, listen
about half past eight o’clock. And if the bell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
rings five times, then is silent, then rings five
times more, then is silent, and then rings a
last five strokes, that means there will be no
school.”</p>

<p>“I wish it would ring that way every day,”
whispered Danny Rugg to Sam, as they were
marching back to their room.</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Sam. “I hate school!”</p>

<p>And the worst of it was that his teacher
heard him and Danny whispering, and each
one had to remain in ten minutes later than
the others that afternoon when school was
dismissed.</p>

<p>Bert and Nan took Flossie and Freddie
home at noon and left the smaller twins, who
at once said they would go out and play in
the yard which was covered with snow.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t get your feet wet, my dears,”
cautioned Mrs. Pry. “The reason the principal
let you stay at home was so you
wouldn’t get wet in the snow. And if you’re
going out in the yard to get wet feet, you
might just as well go back to your classes.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be careful,” promised Freddie.</p>

<p>“And if any snow gets down my rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
boots, I’ll take ’em off and empty the snow
out,” said Flossie.</p>

<p>It was Freddie who, a little later, thought
of a way to have some fun. Floundering
about in the snowy yard he saw back of the
garage the big kennel in which Snap, the dog,
used to sleep. A few weeks before this story
opens, Snap had been taken sick, and had
been sent to a dog-doctor to be cured. He
was to remain away several months. So Sam
had cleaned out the kennel and put it back of
the garage.</p>

<p>“I know how we can have lots of fun, Flossie,”
said Freddie.</p>

<p>“How?” asked the little girl.</p>

<p>“We’ll play we’re snowed-in at Snap’s kennel,”
went on the little boy. “We’ll crawl inside
and make believe we’re at the north pole.
It’ll be nice and warm in the dog house, ’cause
there’s a blanket nailed over the door. It’s
like a curtain.”</p>

<p>“All right—let’s do it!” agreed Flossie.
“And if we could have something to eat in
the dog house it would be like a picnic.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get something to eat,” offered Freddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“What’ll you get?”</p>

<p>“Some of Aunt Sallie’s molasses cookies.
She just baked a lot of ’em!”</p>

<p>“All right—get some, and we’ll play
snowed-up in the dog house,” said Flossie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pry was glad to have Freddie ask for
some of her cookies, since the old lady was
rather proud of the way she made them.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with them?”
she asked, as she handed Freddie the cookies.</p>

<p>“Eat ’em,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Of course, my dear, I know that!” laughed
Aunt Sallie. “But where are you going to
eat them?”</p>

<p>“Out by the garage.” Freddie didn’t want
to say anything about the dog house, for fear
Mrs. Pry or Dinah would say he and Flossie
couldn’t play in it.</p>

<p>“Dat’s aw right,” announced Dinah. “De
honey lambs will be safe out by de garage,
’case as how my Sam’s out dere. But don’t
stay out too late, Freddie.”</p>

<p>“We won’t,” he promised.</p>

<p>With the cookies, he and Flossie crawled
into Snap’s kennel. It was plenty large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
enough for them, and they could almost stand
up in the middle, though the sloping roof
made it lower on each side.</p>

<p>As Flossie had said, there was a curtain, an
old piece of carpet, tacked over the front to
keep the cold wind out. And Sam had put
some clean straw in the kennel, ready for the
time when Snap should come back.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is a lovely place!” exclaimed
Flossie, as she snuggled down in the straw.</p>

<p>“It’s fun!” agreed her brother. “Now
we’ll pretend there’s a big snow storm outside
and it’s all piled up against our house
and we can’t get out to find anything to eat.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to,” said Flossie. “’Cause
you got cookies, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Freddie. “I got a lot of
cookies.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll make believe some is roast turkey
and some is cranberry sauce, and it’s
’most Christmas,” went on Flossie. Soon the
two children were pretending in this jolly
way.</p>

<p>Bert and Nan were a bit late coming home
from school that afternoon. Bert stayed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
to do something for Mr. Tarton, and Nan
helped Miss Skell clean off the blackboards.</p>

<p>But when the two older Bobbsey twins
reached home they noticed that Flossie and
Freddie were not in the house. It was getting
dark, too—getting dark earlier than
usual because of storm clouds in the sky.</p>

<p>“Where are Freddie and Flossie?” asked
Nan of Mrs. Pry.</p>

<p>“Playing out in the garage,” was the answer.</p>

<p>But when Nan went out there Sam was
locking the garage for the night.</p>

<p>“Flossie an’ Freddie?” repeated the colored
man. “No, Nan, I haven’t seen ’em. Dey
haven’t been out heah all dis afternoon!”</p>

<p>“Then where can they be?” faltered Nan.
“Oh, I wonder if they can have wandered
away and are lost! Oh, Sam!”</p>

</div>

<h3>SAM GOES AWAY</h3>


<p>“Dose chilluns aren’t lost!” declared Sam
Johnson when he heard what Nan said.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked the Bobbsey girl.</p>

<p>“Cou’se I is!” replied Sam. “Where could
dey be losted at?”</p>

<p>“They might have gone away over the
fields to roll a big snowball, or something like
that,” suggested Nan. “And then they might
have wandered to the woods and now can’t
find their way back.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe dat,” said Sam. “You
say dey came out to play in de garage?”</p>

<p>“That’s what Mrs. Pry says,” answered
Nan. “Freddie came in to get some of her
cookies, and when she asked him what he was
going to do he said he and Flossie were going
to play in the garage.”</p>

<p>Sam shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“I been out here ’most all de afternoon,”
he said. “I didn’t see Flossie or Freddie.
Cou’se dey might hab slipped in when I went
to de house to git a bucket of hot watah. I’ll
take a look around to make suah!”</p>

<p>He opened the garage again and turned on
the electric lights, for it was so equipped.
Then Nan and Sam looked all over the first
floor without finding a sign of the children.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bert, hurrying
out to the garage, having heard from Mrs.
Pry and Dinah that Nan had gone to bring
in the smaller twins.</p>

<p>“Oh, Flossie and Freddie are lost!” half
sobbed Nan.</p>

<p>“I don’t zackly believe dey’s lost,” Sam
stated. “Dey’s jest in some place we don’t
know. I’ll take a look upstairs. Maybe dey
went up dere to play house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe!” eagerly exclaimed Nan.
There was a sleeping room over the garage,
but it was seldom used, Dinah and Sam having
quarters in the Bobbsey house. But
Flossie and Freddie had often gone to this
bedroom to play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>However, they were not up there now, and
Nan cried some real tears when several more
minutes passed and her little brother and sister
could not be found.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?” asked Mrs. Pry,
who had thrown a shawl over her head and
hurried outside.</p>

<p>“We can’t find Flossie and Freddie,” stated
Bert.</p>

<p>“What’s that? Is supper almost ready?”
inquired the deaf old lady. “Why, yes, it
will be in a minute. Bring the little ones in
and we’ll eat.”</p>

<p>“We can’t find them! We can’t find Flossie
and Freddie!” called out Bert, this time
so loudly that Mrs. Pry heard.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness!” she exclaimed. “Why,
they came in and got some cookies—at least,
Freddie did. Have you called for them?
Maybe they’ve fallen asleep in the snow.
I’ve heard that being out in the snow makes
one sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Say, we haven’t called!” said Bert. “I’ll
give a shout!”</p>

<p>He did, several of them. He called at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
top of his voice for Flossie and Freddie,
standing outside the garage.</p>

<p>And then, to the surprise of all, Freddie’s
voice answered:</p>

<p>“Here we are! What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Where are you?” asked Bert, for he could
not locate the voice.</p>

<p>“In the dog house!” answered Freddie, and
a moment later he and Flossie, rubbing their
eyes—for they had fallen asleep—came
around the corner of the building. Bits of
straw were clinging to the children.</p>

<p>“Where in the world have you been?” cried
Nan. “We’ve been looking all over for you!”</p>

<p>“We were in Snap’s kennel,” explained
Freddie. “We went in there to play snowed-in.”</p>

<p>“And we made believe the molasses cookies
were turkey and cranberry sauce,” went on
Flossie. “And then we went to sleep.”</p>

<p>“For the land sakes!” cried Mrs. Pry.</p>

<p>Sam Johnson was laughing. He picked up
Flossie and Freddie in his strong arms and
carried them to the house. Dinah was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
getting ready to come out and see what the
trouble was.</p>

<p>“Mah good land ob massy!” exclaimed the
fat colored cook when she heard the story.
“To t’ink ob mah honey lambs bein’ out in de
dog house!”</p>

<p>“It was a nice place, with clean straw,”
stated Freddie.</p>

<p>“An’ the cookies were awful good!” added
Flossie. “But we ate ’em all up and I’m hungry
again.”</p>

<p>“Suppah’s ready,” Dinah announced.</p>

<p>“And you mustn’t go in the dog house
again,” said Mrs. Pry. “Next time we might
not find you, or maybe you couldn’t get out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we could get out easy enough,” said
Freddie.</p>

<p>Thus the lost ones were found, and though
Nan laughed at how funny the two twins
looked as they came, sleepy-eyed, out of the
dog house with straw clinging to them, she
had been anxious for a time.</p>

<p>That evening Flossie and Freddie went to
bed early, for they were still sleepy from having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
been out in the fresh air nearly all afternoon.
Grace Lavine came over to see Nan,
and Charlie Mason called to play some games
with Bert.</p>

<p>“I came past Danny Rugg’s house on the
way over,” Charlie said to Bert. “What do
you think he was doing?”</p>

<p>“Breaking more church windows?” asked
Bert.</p>

<p>“Breaking church windows? What do
you mean? Do you think Danny smashed
the one near our school?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said Bert in a low voice. “But
don’t say anything about it. I’m trying to
find a way to prove that he did it so I’ll be
cleared.”</p>

<p>“All right, I won’t say anything,” promised
Charlie. “But that isn’t what I saw Danny
doing.”</p>

<p>“Was he looking for his lost gold ring?”</p>

<p>“No, it was too dark for that. But he was
out in the lots near his house—he and Sam
and Joe and some other fellows—and they’re
making a big snow fort.”</p>

<p>“Getting ready to have a snowball fight, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
guess,” suggested Bert. “Well, I’m not going
to fight, if he asks me. I’d rather have a
fight with some other crowd.”</p>

<p>“So’d I,” agreed Charlie. “And I know
something else.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Well, I saw Sam Todd taking a lot of
horse-chestnuts into the fort they’re building.
They’re going to put ’em in snowballs to
make ’em harder.”</p>

<p>“It’s just like Danny Rugg and his crowd!”
growled Bert. “They never do anything
fair! Well, none of our fellows will take
sides against ’em.”</p>

<p>“I guess not!” agreed Charlie.</p>

<p>Grace Lavine laughed when Nan told her
about Flossie and Freddie having been
“lost” in the dog house that afternoon.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think they’re the cutest children!”
exclaimed Grace. “Don’t you just love them,
Nan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. But they’re always into
some mischief or other. I was glad mother
wasn’t here to be worried about them.”</p>

<p>“When is she coming back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know—not until Uncle Rossiter
is better, I guess.”</p>

<p>“And are you twins keeping house all by
yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we have Aunt Sallie Pry.”</p>

<p>Just then Charlie, who was playing a game
of checkers with Bert, made such a sudden
“jump” with one of his kings that he kicked
over a chair near him. It fell to the floor
with a crash.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Aunt Sallie from the
kitchen where she was helping Dinah with the
last of the evening’s work.</p>

<p>“It was only a falling chair,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Somebody combing their hair! Well,
they made noise enough about it, I must
say!” exclaimed the old lady, and Grace and
Nan had to stuff their handkerchiefs in their
mouths to keep from laughing aloud.</p>

<p>Charlie and Grace went home about nine
o’clock, and soon after that the older Bobbsey
twins went to bed. Nan was feeling lonesome
and wished for her mother’s return.
However, she said nothing about it.</p>

<p>It was the next afternoon when Bert came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
hurrying home from school that more news
awaited him and Nan.</p>

<p>“Where’s Sam?” Bert called to Dinah, as
he hurried into the kitchen. “I want him to
fix that runner on my sled. It came loose
again. Where’s Sam, Dinah?”</p>

<p>Nan gave a quick look at the colored cook
and guessed at once that something had happened.</p>

<p>“Is anything wrong, Dinah?” asked Nan,
for she noticed a sad look on the kindly black
face.</p>

<p>“Yes, honey lamb, dey is somethin’ wrong,”
Dinah answered.</p>

<p>“Is it Uncle Rossiter?” asked Bert. “Or is
it——”</p>

<p>He was afraid to ask about his father and
mother.</p>

<p>“No, honey, ’tisn’t quite as bad as dat,”
said Dinah. “But Sam, he done had to go
away.”</p>

<p>“Sam had to go away!” gasped Nan.</p>

<p>“Is he sick?” inquired Bert.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t sick,” Dinah answered. “But
his brother down South is terrible sick, an’ a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
tellygram come sayin’ dat Sam mus’ come
right off quick. So he went on de noon
train.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe Sam’s brother will get
better,” replied Bert.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t dat I’s worryin’ so much about,”
explained Dinah. “But wif Sam gone dey
isn’t no man around de house now, an’ we’s
likely to hab mo’ bad storms. Dey isn’t any
man heah!”</p>

<p>“I can look after things!” cried Bert. “I
can shovel snow ’most as good as Sam. And
I can shovel coal, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be all right,” added Nan.
Though, deep in her heart, she had a feeling
that keeping house with Sam, the big, strong
protector gone, was not going to be as much
fun as it had seemed at first.</p>

</div>

<h3>BERT’S TUMBLE</h3>


<p>Truth to tell, Dinah had worried more on
the children’s account than on her own when
it was found necessary for Sam to go to his
brother, after a telegram had been received
calling him to the South.</p>

<p>“I kin git along by myse’f, without any
man,” Dinah had said to Mrs. Pry when they
had talked it over before the children came
home from school. “But wif Mr. and Mrs.
Bobbsey away, I don’t want mah honey lambs
to git frightened.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they will,” said the old
lady. “The Bobbsey twins—especially the
older ones—seem quite able to look after
themselves, even if Sam has to go.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. Bert took a manly
stand nor did Nan seem much worried, or, if
she was, she did not show it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>As for Flossie and Freddie, nothing worried
them very much nor for very long at a time.
In fact, they did not pay a great deal of attention
to the going of Sam Johnson. They
had seen him around in the morning, and he
was gone when they came home. That was
all there was to it. If Dinah had had to
leave—well, that would be quite a different
thing.</p>

<p>The short early winter afternoon was fading.
It would soon be dark. Sam had
brought in a lot of wood and had carried up a
whole box full of coal before he went away,
so Bert did not have this to do.</p>

<p>“But I’ll go out and lock up the garage,” he
said to Nan. “Sam always does that the last
thing at night, even if none of the cars have
been taken out. Now I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bobbsey kept two automobiles, but
neither was in use now that he and his wife
had gone to Uncle Rossiter’s.</p>

<p>“And be sure the house is locked up well,
too, Bert,” warned Mrs. Pry. “Go over
every door and window to make sure. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
don’t want any burglars coming in, with Sam
away.”</p>

<p>“Huh! If any of dem burglar men come
in, I’ll fix ’em!” declared Dinah.</p>

<p>“What would you do?” asked Bert, looking
at Nan.</p>

<p>“Hit ’em wif mah rollin’ pin—dat’s whut
I’d do!” cried Dinah, shaking the rolling pin,
with which at that moment she was flattening
out the dough for a batch of biscuits.</p>

<p>“I guess that would fix ’em!” laughed Bert.
“But I’ll lock up everything so the burglars
can’t get in.”</p>

<p>That evening when Flossie and Freddie
had, as usual, gone to bed early and while
Bert and Nan were studying their lessons, a
knock sounded on the side door.</p>

<p>“My goodness! what’s that?” cried Mrs.
Pry, almost jumping out of the chair in which
she was sitting mending stockings. Dinah
was out in the kitchen, “setting” the pancakes
for the next morning.</p>

<p>“Some one’s at de side do’,” said the colored
cook. “I’ll go see who ’tis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried deaf Mrs. Pry. “Did
you say you fell on the floor, Dinah?”</p>

<p>“No’m, Miz Pry. I said I’d go to de do’!”</p>

<p>“I wonder who it is and why they didn’t
ring the front door bell?” asked Nan of Bert
in a low voice. “Do you suppose it could be
a tramp?”</p>

<p>“Supposing it is?” asked Bert. “I’m not
afraid. Tramps won’t hurt anybody.”</p>

<p>“No. But he’d be awfully cold and want
to come in,” returned Nan.</p>

<p>But it was no tramp. The next-door
neighbor, Mr. Flander, having seen Sam
leave that day with a valise, guessed that the
colored man had been called out of town.
And knowing that Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey had
left, Mr. Flander called to see if the Bobbsey
twins needed anything.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, we’re all right,” said Bert,
when he learned who it was.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” Mr. Flander said. “No, I
won’t come in, Mrs. Pry. I just ran over
the side garden instead of ringing the bell at
the front door. Well, if you want anything
just let me or my wife know. Don’t let the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Bobbsey twins go hungry or cold, you know.”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s no danger of that,” laughed
Mrs. Pry.</p>

<p>The kind neighbor took his departure, and
soon after that Nan and Bert went to bed.</p>

<p>One of the first things Bert did the next
morning when he came downstairs to breakfast,
was to put on his cap and run out on the
porch.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Mrs. Pry,
who let Dinah do the cooking while she managed
the house and saw to it that the twins
had plenty to eat.</p>

<p>“I’m just going out to look and see if it’s
going to snow any more,” Bert answered.</p>

<p>“Land sakes! do you want more snow?”
laughed the old lady.</p>

<p>“Sure we do,” Bert answered. “There isn’t
quite enough for good sleigh-riding, and it
takes a lot to make snow houses and snow
forts.”</p>

<p>When he came back into the house, Nan
and the other children having in the meanwhile
taken their places at the table, Bert
shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe it will snow to-day,” he
said. “We’ll have to go to school.”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ll have to go to school,”
said Mrs. Pry. “You don’t stay at home just
because it snows, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, if it was a bad storm we wouldn’t
have to go,” explained Bert. “If it snows so
hard in the morning that it’s bad for going to
school, we must stay home, Mr. Tarton said.
The bell will ring five strokes, three times,
and we stay home. But I guess it won’t ring
that way to-day.”</p>

<p>“I guess it won’t,” agreed Nan. “But
maybe the postman will bring us a letter
from daddy and mother to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope he does!” exclaimed Bert. “It
seems as if they’d been away a week, doesn’t
it, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Longer than that,” Nan answered.</p>

<p>Just then Flossie began to tap her fork on
her plate and exclaim:</p>

<p>“Make him stop! Make Freddie stop!”</p>

<p>“Make him stop what?” Bert wanted to
know. “He isn’t doing anything, Flossie.”</p>

<p>“He was looking over at my plate,” went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
on the little girl. “Make him stop it! Now
you quit, Freddie Bobbsey!”</p>

<p>“Looking at your plate! The idea!”
laughed Nan. “As if that did any harm!
What’s the matter with you this morning,
Flossie? Why don’t you want Freddie to
look at your plate?”</p>

<p>“’Cause he looks at it so hungry-like,”
Flossie explained. “He’s eaten his own griddle
cake all up, and the maple syrup, too, and
maybe he’s going to take mine.”</p>

<p>“I am not!” cried Freddie.</p>

<p>“Well, you looked so!” insisted Flossie.
“Now you stop looking at my plate!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be so fussy,” said Nan. “Dinah
will give Freddie another griddle cake, and
you, also, Flossie, if you want one.”</p>

<p>“I want one,” Freddie quickly said. “I
was looking at hers,” he admitted; “but I
wasn’t going to take it.”</p>

<p>Then Dinah came in with another plate of
the smoking, brown cakes and peace was restored
between the two small Bobbsey twins.
A little later breakfast was over and the four
children started for school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“If a letter comes from mother, please put
it where we’ll see it the first thing when we
come in, Mrs. Pry,” said Nan to the old lady.</p>

<p>“What’s that? You’ve lost your ring?”
exclaimed Aunt Sallie. “Oh, my dear, you
must look for it. Lost your ring—that’s too
bad!”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t say anything about a ring!”
answered Nan, speaking more loudly. “I
said put mother’s letter, if it comes, where
we can see it the first thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, my dear, I’ll do that. I thought
you spoke of a ring. I don’t seem to hear so
very well this morning. I think it must be
going to snow again. My hearing is always
worse just before a storm. But I hardly believe
your folks would have had time to write
yet. They’ll be very busy with your sick
uncle. But if a letter does come I’ll take
care of it.”</p>

<p>“It’s funny she thought I said ring,” remarked
Nan to Bert as they walked along to
school. “And that reminds me—did Danny
Rugg find his ring?”</p>

<p>“Not that I heard of,” answered Bert. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
looked down at his bundle of books and suddenly
exclaimed: “Oh, I forgot and left my
arithmetic at home. I’ll run back and get
it. You go on with Flossie and Freddie.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be late!” cautioned Nan.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” promised her brother, as he
sped back toward the house, only a few blocks
away. Flossie and Freddie wanted to know
where Bert was going, and Nan told them.
Then she hastened on with them toward
school.</p>

<p>But Bert did not find his book as quickly
as he thought he would, not remembering
where he had put it the night before, and
when it was found, and he was hurrying back
on his way to school, Nan and the others
were out of sight.</p>

<p>However, Bert still had plenty of time,
though he kept to a jog trot which soon
brought him within sight of the school. But
Nan and the others had taken a short cut,
and were already inside the building.</p>

<p>Just as Bert was approaching the church,
the stained-glass window of which had been
broken by a snowball, the Bobbsey boy saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
ahead of him Danny Rugg. Danny was
alone, and before the trouble Bert would have
run up and joined him, for he and Danny
were friendly. But that was before the window
was broken. Now Bert did not care to
be friends with this boy, and so he hung back.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait until he turns into the school
yard before I go in,” said Bert to himself.</p>

<p>But there was a surprise in store for him.
Instead of keeping on to school, when he got
in front of the church, a short distance from
the school, Danny gave a quick look around.
Just then Bert happened to be behind a tree.
From here he could see Danny, but Danny
could not see him.</p>

<p>And, as it happened just then, no other
boys or girls were near the church. Seeing
this, Danny Rugg gave a quick little run and
darted inside the church, a side door of which
was open.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that!” exclaimed
Bert, half aloud. “Why is Danny
Rugg going into the church this time of
morning? Maybe he’s going to ring the bell
for a joke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>But as he thought of this, Bert did not believe
it could be done. The rope of the
church bell was high in a belfry and the door
was kept locked. Bert knew this because
once some boys had gotten in and rung the
bell in the middle of the night. Since then
the bell rope room had been kept locked.</p>

<p>“But why did Danny go in the church?”
asked Bert of himself again.</p>

<p>There was only one way which the question
could be answered, and so Bert decided on
doing a bold thing. He looked at the clock
in the church steeple. It was barely half
past eight, and he had plenty of time.</p>

<p>So, waiting until Danny should have had a
chance to get well within the church, Bert followed,
walking softly to make no noise. And
all the while Bert was puzzling over the reason
why Danny had entered.</p>

<p>Coming in from out-of-doors, with the
ground covered with snow, which dazzled
him, Bert could see hardly a thing in the dark
church entry. The side door opened into a
vestibule in the rear of the church.</p>

<p>Unable to see where he was going, Bert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
stood still a moment. He knew that his eyes
would become accustomed to the gloom in a
little while, and he would be able to see better.</p>

<p>He listened, and heard Danny walking
about.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s going upstairs—to the balcony!”
whispered Bert. “I can hear him going
upstairs! I wonder why he’s doing
that?”</p>

<p>Bert took a few steps forward and then
suddenly felt himself falling.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” he gasped as he realized what
had happened. He had stepped into an open
trapdoor in the center of the vestibule floor,
and was tumbling into the cellar of the
church!</p>

<h3>NAN IS WORRIED</h3>


<p>Bert Bobbsey was not a long while falling
through the trapdoor. In fact, it took hardly
a second. But in that short time the boy had
time to hear Danny Rugg come clattering
down the stairs that led to the balcony of the
church. And from the speed with which
Danny ran, Bert guessed that the other boy
was frightened.</p>

<p>“I guess the noise I made when I stumbled
and yelled scared Danny,” thought Bert.
Later he learned that this was so.</p>

<p>But poor Bert did not have time to think
of much. He felt himself falling, he heard
Danny’s frightened rush out of the church,
and then Bert landed on what seemed to be a
pile of old bags in the basement of the church.</p>

<p>Then Bert felt a sharp pain in his head,
which struck something hard, and a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
later stars seemed to be dancing in front of
his eyes—stars in the darkness. Then Bert
knew nothing more. He was unconscious,
just as if he had fainted.</p>

<p>And there the poor lad was, alone in the
dark basement.</p>

<p>Danny Rugg did not know who or what it
was that had made the noise. He did not
stop to inquire, but darted to the side door
of the church, and, making sure by looking
up and down the street that no one saw him,
he slipped out and ran on to school.</p>

<p>Nan Bobbsey, with the smaller Bobbsey
twins, had gone in some time before. Leaving
Flossie and Freddie in their classroom,
Nan went to hers to do a little early studying.
She expected Bert to come in soon, and when
it got to be a quarter of nine and her brother
had not yet entered, though several other
pupils had, Nan was not worried. She
thought Bert, after going back after his arithmetic,
had met some of his chums and was
having fun with them on the way to school.</p>

<p>Bert was seldom late, but often he and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
some of his chums entered the classroom just
as the last bell was ringing its last strokes.</p>

<p>But when the hands of the clock pointed to
five minutes of nine, when Miss Skell was at
her desk, and most of the other boys and girls
were in their seats, Nan began to get uneasy.
Each time footsteps sounded in the hall outside
the room she hoped it would be Bert who
was coming. But he did not enter.</p>

<p>The last bell began to ring. Nan moved
uneasily in her seat. She did not want her
brother to be late.</p>

<p>The last bell stopped ringing.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” thought Nan, with a sinking
heart. For now Bert could not enter without
being marked tardy. And to Nan, as well as
to many other pupils, this was a sad thing to
have happen.</p>

<p>Miss Skell took out her roll book and began
to call the names of the pupils. They
were arranged in alphabetical order, beginning
with those whose last name started with
the letter A. And of course Bobbsey, beginning
with B, was soon reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“Bert Bobbsey!” called Miss Skell.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The teacher raised
her eyes from the book and looked around the
room.</p>

<p>“Bert Bobbsey!” she called again, for Bert
was seldom absent and Nan could not remember
when he had been late.</p>

<p>There was no answer, of course. For at
that moment, though none in the room knew
it, poor Bert was lying unconscious in the
church basement.</p>

<p>Then Miss Skell looked at Nan, whose
name was next on the list. She marked Nan
as being present, and then asked:</p>

<p>“Is Bert sick to-day, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Miss Skell,” said Nan, very seriously.
“He started for school the same time
I did. Then he didn’t have his arithmetic
and went back after it. I don’t know what
happened to him. I don’t know why he isn’t
here.”</p>

<p>Nan’s voice began to tremble a little. A
thought entered her mind that perhaps, when
Bert went back to get his book, something
had happened at home—either to Dinah or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Mrs. Pry—and Bert had had to stay to look
after things.</p>

<p>“Or,” thought Nan to herself, “maybe a
telegram came with bad news about Uncle
Rossiter—or mother or daddy—and Bert
had to go out there.”</p>

<p>But on second thoughts she hardly believed
this possible. Bert would not start alone on
a long journey without telling her.</p>

<p>Miss Skell saw that Nan was troubled, so
the teacher said:</p>

<p>“Probably Bert had an errand to do that
detained him. Or, after coming to school,
Mr. Tarton may have met him downstairs
and asked him to do something. I think that
is it—Bert has gone on an errand for the principal.
In that case I will not mark him
tardy. I will wait until after the morning
exercises.”</p>

<p>Nan Bobbsey breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, Bert might have been sent somewhere
by the principal. The Bobbsey boy
had often gone on errands for the head of the
school, and this, of course, always excused
one from being marked tardy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Miss Skell went on calling the roll, and
soon the boys and girls marched to the big
assembly hall where the morning exercises
were held. Mr. Tarton was in charge, as
usual, and as Nan looked at the principal, up
on the platform, she wished she could ask him
whether or not he had sent Bert on an errand.</p>

<p>Miss Skell, however, seemed to know what
was going on in Nan’s mind, for when the
class was back in its room the teacher said:</p>

<p>“Nan, you may go to Mr. Tarton’s office
to ask whether he sent Bert on an errand.
Then come back and tell me.”</p>

<p>The Bobbsey girl hurried down the stairs
and into the office where Mr. Tarton sat at
his desk. Many books were in cases about
the room. The principal’s office was rather a
solemn place, and especially so for any of the
boys or girls who were sent there when they
had done something against the rules. However,
Nan was easy in her mind on this point,
though she was worried about her brother.</p>

<p>“Well, Nan, what is it?” asked Mr. Tarton.
Though he had a large school, he knew nearly
every pupil in it by his or her first name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
“Did Miss Skell send you with a note to
me?” he went on.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Nan. “But she said
I might come to ask about my brother Bert.”</p>

<p>“What about Bert?” asked the principal,
with a smile. “Has he been throwing any
more snowballs? I won’t ask if he has
broken any more windows, for, even though
Sam Todd says Bert did it, I have doubts in
my mind on that point. But what about
Bert?”</p>

<p>“Did you send him on an errand?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Nan. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Bert isn’t in his class. He didn’t come to
school. He started with me and ran back to
get his arithmetic, and I—I don’t know what
has happened to him.”</p>

<p>Nan’s voice faltered and she was about to
cry. Mr. Tarton noticed this and said
kindly:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. We’ll find Bert for you.
Very likely when he got back home your
mother sent him to the store. He may come
a little late, but if he does, and has a good
excuse, he will not be marked tardy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my mother couldn’t send Bert to the
store, because she and my father have gone
away!” exclaimed Nan.</p>

<p>“Well, then some one at your house may
have sent Bert to the store.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Pry or Dinah might,” admitted
Nan.</p>

<p>“We can soon find out,” went on the principal.
“You have a telephone, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I will call up and ask if Bert went anywhere.
Wait a moment.”</p>

<p>The principal was about to call up the
Bobbsey house when he happened to think of
something.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better not do this,” he said
to Nan. “It might be that Bert went off by
himself. I don’t mean that he played truant,
Nan,” he said, as he heard the girl gasp. “I
mean he might have met some one from your
father’s office, or something like that. Those
at your house—the servant or this old lady
that you told me was helping you keep house—would
know nothing about it, and it
might worry them if we asked about Bert.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what to do. I’ll ask Miss
Skell to excuse you, and you may go home to
see if Bert is there. If he isn’t, come back
and let me know. Then I will do something
else. You need not alarm Dinah or Mrs.
Pry. I will ask you to go home to get me a
certain book. Let me see, I remember Bert
once brought to school a book of your father’s
containing a number of fine poems for recitation.
I’ll send you home to get that book.
Then you won’t worry the old lady. How
will that do, Nan?”</p>

<p>“It will be a good plan, I think,” Nan answered.
“And I hope I’ll find Bert there.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Or at least learn whether or not he
has been sent on an errand,” added the principal.
“Give this note to Miss Skell.”</p>

<p>He hastily wrote one, and when Miss Skell
read it she said to Nan:</p>

<p>“Get on your hat and coat and go.”</p>

<p>The boys and girls in the room, noting that
Bert was not present and seeing Nan go out,
did not know what to think. It was very
mysterious.</p>

<p>But it was more than mysterious to Nan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Bobbsey when she reached home and saw
nothing of Bert. Mrs. Pry saw the girl coming
up the steps and opened the door for her.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear, school isn’t out already, is
it?” asked the old lady.</p>

<p>“No, I came back to get a book for Mr.
Tarton,” Nan answered. “Did Bert get his
arithmetic?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, he found it,” said Mrs. Pry, “and he
hurried right out with it. I told him to hurry
so he wouldn’t be late for school.”</p>

<p>So Nan learned, without really asking, that
Bert had not been sent on an errand by either
Mrs. Pry or Dinah.</p>

<p>“Oh, where can he be?” thought poor Nan,
as she hurried back to school with the book
of poems. “What has happened to him?
How can Mr. Tarton ever find him?”</p>

<h3>A CALL FOR DINAH</h3>


<p>How long Bert Bobbsey lay unconscious in
the basement of the church he did not know.
It seemed a very long time to him, but it was
probably not more than an hour—perhaps
not that long.</p>

<p>The last thing he remembered was seeing a
lot of what appeared to be brightly dancing
stars in front of his eyes. And he saw them
even though it was very dark in the basement.
This was caused when his head struck something.
And Bert also remembered, as among
the last things that sounded in his ears, the
footsteps of Danny Rugg as he hurried out
of the church.</p>

<p>And now, as Bert recovered consciousness,
or “came to,” as it is sometimes called, he
heard some one moving about near him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the basement. He also saw a light glinting
about.</p>

<p>At first the lad thought this was Danny
Rugg, and Bert felt so ill and helpless that he
would have been glad of help even from
Danny.</p>

<p>“Hey! Hey!” Bert faintly called.</p>

<p>Then a voice answered—a voice which
wasn’t that of Danny—it was the voice of
the church sexton, Mr. Shull. Bert remembered
this voice very well.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Mr. Shull.
“What’s that? Is any one here in the basement?”
he asked.</p>

<p>Bert saw the light coming nearer and then
he knew the sexton was moving about with
one of those small electric flashlights.</p>

<p>“Is anybody here?” asked the sexton again.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” answered Bert, but his voice
was so weak that the man, as well as he knew
Bert, did not recognize the tones.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” called Mr. Shull, coming
nearer with the light.</p>

<p>“Bert Bobbsey,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! how did you get here?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Why, you’re hurt!” the man cried, as he
flashed the light on Bert. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>He saw Bert lying huddled on a pile of
bags and old pieces of carpet just beneath the
open trapdoor. But for the moment the sexton
did not think of the opening in the floor
above. So Bert said:</p>

<p>“I came in here——” He was going to tell
why he entered, then he happened to think
perhaps this would not be wise. He did not
want to mention Danny Rugg. “I saw the
door open and I came in,” went on Bert. “It
was dark, and I walked across the vestibule,
and then I fell down the trapdoor. I guess
I’ve been here a long while.”</p>

<p>“You poor boy!” exclaimed Mr. Shull, laying
his flashlight down on a box and leaving
it still glowing as he raised Bert up. “I’m so
sorry! I opened the trapdoor to throw down
some old bags and pieces of carpet. Then I
had to fix the furnace and I forgot about the
trap being open.</p>

<p>“But you haven’t been here so very long,
Bert, for I only opened the church about two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
hours ago. It’s only a little after ten o’clock
now, maybe not quite that.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ve been here about two hours,” decided
Bert, for he remembered it was about
half past eight when he followed Danny into
the church.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t seem to be hurt much,”
the sexton went on, as he saw that Bert could
stand up. Mr. Shull flashed the light over
the boy from head to foot. No bones were
broken, though Bert’s clothes were a bit dusty
and covered with cobwebs. The boy put his
hand to his head.</p>

<p>“Is that where it hurts you?” asked Mr.
Shull.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I hit my head on something
when I fell.”</p>

<p>“It was this box,” and the sexton focused
his light on one that rested on the floor just
below the opening of the trapdoor. “Let me
see, Bert.”</p>

<p>Very gently, while he held the light in one
hand, so it was shining on Bert’s head, the
sexton passed his fingers over the lad’s scalp.</p>

<p>“It isn’t even cut,” he said. “You’re all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
right. The blow made you unconscious for
a time, but that’s all. I’m very sorry it happened.
I’ll help you upstairs and get you a
drink of water. That will make you feel
better.”</p>

<p>Bert did feel decidedly better after drinking
some water, and then the sexton turned
on an electric light in the vestibule and made
Bert sit down in a chair.</p>

<p>“The first thing I’ll do is to close that trapdoor,”
said Mr. Shull. “I don’t want any
one else falling down there.”</p>

<p>Bert wondered how it was that Danny
Rugg hadn’t fallen down, but he decided the
other boy must have passed to one side of the
opening.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Mr. Shull, as he
slammed the trapdoor shut. “I shouldn’t
have left that open but I didn’t expect anybody
to come in the church at this time of
day. And it’s mighty lucky for you, Bert,
that I had tossed those old bags and carpets
down right under the trap. Falling on them
probably saved you from having broken
bones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so,” Bert said. He was glad
the sexton did not think to ask him why he
had come into the church. To tell that
would mean to mention Danny Rugg. And,
somehow or other, Bert wanted to keep this a
secret. He had an idea that Danny had a
secret reason for going into the church.</p>

<p>“And maybe I can find out why,” thought
Bert to himself.</p>

<p>He was feeling much better now, and when
the sexton gave him another drink and then
got a whisk broom and flicked the dust and
cobwebs off Bert’s clothes, the Bobbsey boy
was almost himself again.</p>

<p>There was a lump on his head where it had
struck against the edge of the box, and his
head felt sore, while one of his shoulders
ached. But Bert had been hurt worse than
this playing football, and he was not going to
mind now.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to take you home
Bert?” asked the sexton.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I have to go to school!” the boy
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ll excuse you from school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
when they hear what’s happened,” said Mr.
Shull. “But do you feel able to go back to
your class?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think so,” Bert said. His head
was clearer now and did not ache so badly.
“I’ll be late, though, I suppose,” he added.</p>

<p>“Just a little,” chuckled the church sexton.
“But I’ll tell Principal Tarton about it, and
he’ll excuse you, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Making certain that Bert’s clothes were
now well brushed, Mr. Shull started for the
side door of the church, keeping near the boy
in case he felt “tottery on his pins,” as the
sexton spoke of it afterward, meaning that
Bert might be weak in his legs. But he
wasn’t, and when he got out in the fresh, cold
air he felt quite himself again.</p>

<p>Mr. Shull walked with Bert as far as the
schoolyard gate, and there saw Henry Kling,
the school janitor.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bert!” exclaimed Mr. Kling.
“What’s the matter? Your sister just came
in. She’s been back home looking for you.”</p>

<p>“Nan has been looking for me!” cried Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes. You didn’t come to school and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
was worried. Mr. Tarton let her go home,
thinking maybe you’d been sent on an errand
some place. But Nan just came back. She
was ’most crying and I asked her what the
matter was. So she told me. Where in the
world have you been?”</p>

<p>“Down in the church basement,” Bert answered,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Not playing hookey? Don’t tell me you
tried to play hookey!” cried the janitor, who
liked Bert.</p>

<p>“No, I fell through a trapdoor,” the boy
said, and he briefly explained what had happened.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better hurry right into Mr.
Tarton’s office and tell him about it,” advised
Mr. Kling. “The whole school will be looking
for you if you don’t.”</p>

<p>You can imagine how glad Nan was to
learn that Bert had been found.</p>

<p>She went back to tell Mr. Tarton that her
brother had not gone on any home errand.
Then, by telephoning to the lumber office,
they learned that none of the men there knew
any reason why Bert should not be at school.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
The principal did not know what to think.
And then Bert came in, much to the surprise,
but also to the joy, of his sister.</p>

<p>“Well, the lost boy is found!” exclaimed
the principal. He smiled at Bert, for he
could see that it was not the boy’s fault that
he was late for school.</p>

<p>Bert explained matters and again he was
glad that no one asked him why he had gone
into the church.</p>

<p>“I think you may be excused for the remainder
of the morning, Bert,” said the head
of the school. “And you needn’t come back
this afternoon unless you feel quite well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I feel all right!” Bert was quick to
say. “I’d rather stay now than go home.
If I go home, Mrs. Pry will think I’m sick,
and she might make me take some medicine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” chuckled Mr. Tarton. “Well,
suit yourself. Here is a note to Miss Skell,
telling her not to mark you tardy,” and he
hastily wrote a few lines on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Bert.</p>

<p>Then he and Nan went to their room,
where their entrance created no little excitement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
All the other boys and girls wondered
why Nan had gone out and why Bert
came in late.</p>

<p>They found out at noon time, for Bert told
his story. But still he did not say anything
about having followed Danny Rugg into the
church.</p>

<p>Of course Danny heard the story of Bert’s
tumble, and Danny must have known that it
was the sound of Bert’s fall that had caused
the noise which frightened him away.</p>

<p>But Danny said nothing to Bert on the
subject, nor did Bert mention it to Danny.
In fact, he and Danny did not play together
any more. They were not exactly “bad
friends,” but they were not on good terms,
and hardly did more than nod or say “hello!”
when meeting.</p>

<p>“I’m just as well satisfied,” Bert said to
Nan when they were on their way home to
lunch that noon. “I don’t like Danny any
more.”</p>

<p>“Why did he go into the church, do you
think?” asked Nan, for of course Bert told
his twin about following the other lad inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know why he went in,” Bert answered.
“It was queer. I wanted to find
out. That’s why I went in after him. But
I didn’t think there’d be a hole for me to fall
into.”</p>

<p>Nothing was said at home about Bert’s fall,
for he did not want Dinah or Mrs. Pry to
worry needlessly. And he felt all right again,
especially after a good lunch.</p>

<p>“Did any letter come from mother or
daddy?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” answered Mrs. Pry. “Perhaps
one will come to-morrow. Don’t worry—your
folks are all right.”</p>

<p>But that afternoon when it began to snow
again, though Bert and the boys greeted the
swirling flakes with shouts of joy, Nan felt
much worried.</p>

<p>As the storm seemed likely to be a heavy
one, as soon as she was out of school Nan
hurried home with Flossie and Freddie. The
younger twins had not heard the talk about
Bert’s fall, and so would not mention it to
either Mrs. Pry or Dinah.</p>

<p>Bert did not go home with Nan and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
smaller children. He stayed to have some
fun in the snow with Charlie Mason and John
Marsh. And he had so much fun and felt so
much better, after his fall, to be out in the
air that it was not until it was almost dark
that he ran home.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert!” cried Nan, meeting him at the
door. “Something has happened!”</p>

<p>“Uncle Rossiter!” cried Bert. “Is he——”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t about Uncle Rossiter,” answered
Nan. “Oh, I’ve been waiting and
waiting for you to come home to tell you!
Dinah has gone away!”</p>

<p>“Dinah gone away!” cried Bert blankly.
“What for?”</p>

<p>It seemed as if the bottom had dropped out
of everything with the faithful colored cook
away from the house and with Sam also gone.</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Bert.</p>

</div>

<h3>LUMBAGO</h3>


<p>“Come on in and shut the door,” said Nan
before she took time to answer her brother’s
question about what had caused Dinah to go
away. “Mrs. Pry doesn’t like the cold. We
must keep the house warm for her, she says.”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t cold!” declared Bert, whose cheeks
were rosy red from having been playing in the
snow. But he hurried in, closed the door,
and then, turning to Nan, while he listened
to the voices of Freddie and Flossie having
one of their endless disputes in the playroom,
the lad asked: “What happened to Dinah?
What made her go away?”</p>

<p>“It’s on account of Sam,” answered Nan.</p>

<p>“Do you mean Sam came back and took
Dinah away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Sam didn’t come back,” went on
Nan. “That’s the reason Dinah had to go—because
Sam didn’t come back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“Say!” cried Bert with a little laugh,
though he could see by the look on his sister’s
face that she did not feel very jolly, “this is
like one of the puzzles Charlie Mason asks.
Where in the world is Dinah, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“She had to go down South—I don’t remember
just where—to look after Sam,” explained
Nan. “Something has happened to
him—he’s sick, or something—and a telegram
came for Dinah. She must have got
it while we were at school, for when I got
home, and I came ahead of you, I found Mrs.
Pry all excited and Dinah was packed up,
all ready to go. She wanted to wait until
you got back, to tell you good-bye, but I told
her to go, or else she’d miss her train.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bert. “But how did
she know Sam was sick? Who told her?”</p>

<p>“A telegram came, I told you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s so—you did. So many things
are happening that I forget about some of
them. But did Dinah have to walk to the
station and carry her bag? I wish I’d been
here—I’d ’a’ carried it for her.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t have to walk,” explained Nan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
“Just before it was time for her to go Mr.
Batten called up from the lumber office.
Daddy left word before he and mother went
to Uncle Rossiter’s that Mr. Batten was to
call up every day and find out if we were all
right.</p>

<p>“So when Mr. Batten called, I told him
about Dinah having to go down South where
her husband, Sam, was sick, and Mr. Batten
said he’d have one of the men stop around
in an auto and take her to the station, and he
did. So Dinah went down in style all right.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” Bert said. “But say,
Nan, we’re almost all alone, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, only Mrs. Pry left to keep house
for us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we could keep house all by
ourselves if we had to,” Bert said. “Don’t
you think so, Nan?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. But is your head all right
now, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it doesn’t hurt at all.”</p>

<p>“Why do you s’pose it was that Danny
Rugg went into the church?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Bert, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
thought the matter over for a second or two.
“Maybe he went in to see if he could mend
the broken window so he wouldn’t have to
pay for it.”</p>

<p>“How could he mend a broken window,
Bert? It’s got all different colored pieces of
glass in it. Danny couldn’t mend it, even if
he could find all the bits of broken glass.
They wouldn’t stick together.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess that’s right. Well, I don’t
know why Danny went in. But if he goes
again maybe I’ll find out next time.”</p>

<p>By this time the voices of Flossie and Freddie
had become high and shrill. They were
evidently having trouble of some kind. And
as Bert and Nan stood talking in the hall,
Mrs. Pry was heard to say:</p>

<p>“Freddie! Freddie! Stop that!”</p>

<p>Then Flossie’s voice joined in with:</p>

<p>“Give me my doll, Freddie Bobbsey! Give
me my doll else I’ll tell mother on you.”</p>

<p>“Mother isn’t at home, so you can’t tell
her!” taunted Freddie.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell her when she does come
home. Give me my doll!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“I guess we’d better go see what it is,” suggested
Nan.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bert. “Dinah could make
Flossie and Freddie mind better than Mrs.
Pry can. But Dinah isn’t here, so we’ll have
to do it.”</p>

<p>The two older Bobbsey twins hurried up to
the playroom on the second floor. There
they saw Mrs. Pry standing in the middle of
the carpet, looking helplessly at Flossie and
Freddie. The little girl was trying to pull
one of her dolls away from her brother, who
held on to it with all his might.</p>

<p>“Here, Freddie, you let go of Flossie’s
doll!” ordered Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes, make him give her to me!” begged
Flossie.</p>

<p>“Shame on you, Freddie Bobbsey!” cried
Nan. “Why do you want to tease your sister—and
you’re a big boy? Daddy used to call
you his fireman, but he wouldn’t call you that
now!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I wasn’t going to hurt her old
doll,” answered Freddie, as he slowly let go
his hold on the doll’s legs. Nan’s appeal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
him, and the mention of “fireman,” which
was his father’s pet name for the little chap,
made Freddie feel a bit ashamed of himself.
“I wasn’t going to hurt the doll,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was too!” cried Flossie. “He was
going to make her stand on her head.”</p>

<p>“Well, that wouldn’t hurt her,” Freddie
answered, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“It would so!” declared Flossie. “Once I
stood on my head and it may me feel funny
and my face got red and Dinah said the blood
would come out of my ears if I didn’t stand
up straight, so I did. I don’t want my doll
to have blood come out of her ears.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that would happen,” said
Nan. “But Freddie should leave your doll
alone and play with his own things. Now
don’t tease Flossie any more.”</p>

<p>“All right, I won’t,” Freddie promised, for
he was not a bad little fellow, only mischievous
at times. And so was Flossie, for that
matter. She wasn’t a bit better than Freddie.
Being twins, they were much alike in
many things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to keep peace between
them, but I don’t seem to know how to do
it,” sighed Mrs. Pry. “I hope now, with
Dinah and Sam gone, as well as your father
and mother, that you will be good children,”
she added.</p>

<p>“I think they will,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“What’s that? You’re going to take them
out on the hill?” cried the old lady. “Oh, I
wouldn’t do that! Don’t take them coasting
now. It’s almost dark and supper is nearly
ready.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I’d taken them to the hill,”
answered Nan. “I said they will be good
children now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Well, I’m sure I hope so,” sighed
Aunt Sallie Pry. “I must see the doctor
about my ears,” she went on. “I can’t hear
half as good as I could five years ago, or else
people don’t speak as plainly as they used
to. Well, now that Bert is home, we’ll have
supper. Oh, dear, I hope we don’t get any
more snow.”</p>

<p>“When’s Dinah coming back?” asked Freddie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
as he came out of the bathroom, where
he washed his hands ready for the meal.</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty soon, I guess,” answered Nan.</p>

<p>“When are mother and daddy coming
back?” Flossie wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they’ll come home pretty
soon, too,” said Bert, with a look at his sister.
A little later, while Flossie and Freddie were
taking their places at the table, Bert whispered
to Nan: “Don’t you think it’s queer
we haven’t had a letter from mother since she
went away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is queer,” agreed Nan. “I wish
we’d get some news. But maybe Uncle Rossiter
is too sick for them to have time to
write.”</p>

<p>“Well, couldn’t they send a telegram?”
Bert inquired.</p>

<p>“Maybe they thought a telegram would
scare us,” suggested Nan. “Dinah was
frightened when that one came about
Sam.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed her brother. “I guess
maybe that’s why mother didn’t telegraph
us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Or maybe the snow’s so deep where they
are that the mail can’t get through,” went on
Nan. “Lots of times, in winter, they can’t
deliver the mail on account of snow.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Bert. “I guess maybe
they’re all right. Anyhow, there’s no good
of worrying. And we’ll have fun keeping
house by ourselves, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Lots of fun,” agreed Nan.</p>

<p>However, a little later, it did not seem
quite so much fun, for something happened
that would not have happened, very likely,
if Mrs. Bobbsey had been at home.</p>

<p>With Dinah away, it made more work for
Mrs. Pry, who got the evening meal, though
Nan and Bert helped all they could. They
knew how to do many things about the
kitchen and the dining room, for their mother
had allowed them to help Dinah so they
would have good training.</p>

<p>It happened that when Mrs. Pry was coming
from the kitchen with a plate of slices of
bread, Flossie saw her. All at once it entered
into the mind of the little girl that she
ought to help, as she had seen Nan doing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
So, climbing down out of her chair, Flossie,
with the kindest heart in the world, ran to
Mrs. Pry, calling:</p>

<p>“I’ll help you, Aunt Sallie! Let me help!
I’ll carry the plate of bread for you.”</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear!” objected the old lady.
“You might spill the bread off the plate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no I won’t!” cried Flossie.</p>

<p>“If she spills the bread, that wouldn’t
break,” laughed Freddie.</p>

<p>“No, but she might drop the plate, and
that would crack,” Nan said. “Flossie, dear,
go back to your place!”</p>

<p>But Flossie did not want to do this. She
had made up her mind to help about the meal
in some way. So she reached up to take the
plate away from Mrs. Pry, and the old lady,
naturally, held the plate out of Flossie’s
grasp.</p>

<p>“I’ll jump up and get it!” the little girl
cried. “Mother said I was to be good and
help Dinah all I could. And now Dinah’s
gone, I’ll help you, Aunt Sallie!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t need to be helped, my dear,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
said Mrs. Pry. “I can carry this plate of
bread.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me do it!” begged Flossie.</p>

<p>Her first jump was not quite high enough,
so she leaped a second time, and, though Mrs.
Pry held the plate above Flossie’s head, the
little girl got hold of it. She pulled it from
the old lady’s hands, but, instead of keeping
hold of it herself, Flossie let it slip from her
fingers.</p>

<p>Down fell the plate of bread to the floor.
The slices tumbled off and the plate itself was
broken in three pieces.</p>

<p>“Oh, now you’ve done it!” cried Freddie.
“Oh, look what Flossie did! She broke a
plate! Flossie broke a plate! Flossie broke
a plate!” he cried in a sing-song voice.</p>

<p>Flossie looked at the damage she had done
and then her lips began to quiver, her eyes
filled with tears, and a moment later she
burst out crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t tell mother!” she begged.
“Don’t tell mother! I didn’t mean to break
the plate! I wanted to help!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t cry, my dear,” said Aunt Sallie
kindly. “Of course you didn’t mean to do
it. It’s all right. I guess it was only an
old plate.”</p>

<p>“The bread didn’t bust, anyhow,” observed
Freddie. “I can pick that up and we can
eat it!”</p>

<p>“Freddie Bobbsey, you stay right in your
chair!” cried Nan. “Something else will
happen if you get down. And, Flossie, never
mind. You can help with something else.
Go to your chair and we’ll eat.”</p>

<p>Bert picked up the pieces of plate while
Nan gathered up the bread. Luckily the
slices had fallen in the same sort of pile
that Mrs. Pry had put them in on the plate,
and only the bottom slice had to be laid
aside because there might be dirt on it from
the rug.</p>

<p>“I’ll feed that to the birds to-morrow,” said
Bert, as he laid this slice aside.</p>

<p>Flossie stopped her crying and soon supper
was going on merrily—that is, as merrily
as was possible when the Bobbsey twins
were without father, mother, Dinah and Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Pry did her best, and though she misunderstood
a number of things that were said,
on account of not hearing well, the children
did not laugh at her. They felt sorry for
the old lady.</p>

<p>Nan helped clear away the supper dishes,
with Bert lending a hand now and then.
Flossie and Freddie, forgetting all about their
little dispute, played together until it was
time for them to go to bed.</p>

<p>Bert and Nan did their studying for the
next day, and then Bert went about locking
the doors and windows, Mrs. Pry telling him
to be especially careful.</p>

<p>“For burglars might come in, now that
we’re more alone than ever before,” said the
old lady.</p>

<p>“Do the burglars know we’re alone?” asked
Bert, grinning at his sister, for neither of
them felt any fears.</p>

<p>“They might. You never can tell,” answered
Mrs. Pry. “Anyhow, don’t leave any
doors open.”</p>

<p>And of course Bert would not do that.</p>

<p>Just before he and Nan went up to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
rooms, Bert went to the front door to look
out.</p>

<p>“Is the weather doing anything?” Nan
asked.</p>

<p>“It feels like snow,” Bert answered. “It’s
cold and sharp out, and it’s cloudy. Maybe
it’ll snow to-morrow. I hope it does.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” Nan said.</p>

<p>“Why not?” her brother wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because if it does maybe we’ll not get a
letter from mother or daddy for a long time.
Maybe they’re snowed-up now and if it
storms again they’ll be snowed-up worse. I
don’t want any more.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it’ll come anyhow,” Bert
said with a laugh, as he closed and locked
the door.</p>

<p>The children were soon sound asleep and
were not disturbed during the night. Even
Flossie did not wake up as usual and want
Nan to get her a drink.</p>

<p>Nan awakened first the next morning. She
looked at a little clock on her bureau and was
surprised to note that it was half past eight.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be late for school!” she cried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
jumping out of bed. “Mrs. Pry must have
forgotten to call us. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>Nan hurried about, putting on her gown
and slippers, to go and call Bert and also to
arouse Freddie. Flossie had opened her
eyes when she heard Nan moving. Then a
voice from Mrs. Pry’s room said:</p>

<p>“Nan! Nan, dear!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt Sallie, what is it?” asked Nan.
“Are you sick?” The old lady’s voice sounded
different, somehow.</p>

<p>“Yes, Nan, I’m afraid I’m sick,” was the
answer. “That’s why I wasn’t able to get
down and cook the breakfast. The lumbago
has hold of me in the back. The
lumbago has gotten a bad hold of me. Oh,
dear!”</p>

<p>While Nan stood in the middle of the floor,
hardly knowing what to do, Flossie burst into
tears.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h3>THE SCHOOL BELL</h3>


<p>Poor Nan was upset by hearing that Mrs.
Pry was ill in bed when the old lady should
have been up getting breakfast, and Nan was
also rather worried about not hearing from
her father and mother, so that when Flossie
burst out crying it seemed as though too
many things were happening.</p>

<p>“Why, Flossie, what’s the matter?” asked
Nan of her little sister. Nothing special had
happened, as far as Nan could see. Flossie
had not fallen out of her bed, that was certain.
“Are you sick, too, Flossie?” asked
Nan.</p>

<p>“No-oo-oo, I’m not sick,” sobbed Flossie.
“But I—I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of what?” Nan wanted to know.
“There is nothing to be afraid of. It’s morning.
We’re late, and maybe we’ll be tardy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
at school, but that isn’t anything to cry
about.”</p>

<p>“I’m not—now—I’m not crying about
school!” Flossie sobbed. “I’m scared about
Aunt Sallie!”</p>

<p>In her bedroom across the hall the old lady
heard.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid about me, my dear,”
called Aunt Sallie. “I’m not as badly off as
all that, though I don’t believe I’m able to
get around. The lumbago has me by the
back.”</p>

<p>“There! That’s what I’m scared of!”
cried Flossie. “I don’t want the lumbago to
get me! Shut the door, Nan!”</p>

<p>Then Nan understood, and so did Mrs. Pry.</p>

<p>“The little dear,” sighed the old lady. “You
won’t catch the lumbago, Flossie. Little girls
don’t catch the lumbago.”</p>

<p>“No, but maybe the lumbago will catch
me!” and Flossie still sobbed. “Shut the
door, Nan, and keep the lumbago out!”</p>

<p>Then Nan laughed and said:</p>

<p>“Why, I do believe she thinks the lumbago
is a sort of animal! Do you, Flossie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Ye-ye-yes,” was the halting answer. “Isn’t
the lumbago like the wolf in Little Red Riding
Hood?”</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, no!” chuckled Mrs. Pry,
in as jolly a manner as she could, though it
hurt her to laugh. “The lumbago is something
like rheumatism. It catches one in the
back and keeps them in bed. I’ve had it before.
I’ll be better in a few days. Bless
you! the lumbago isn’t a wolf, though it pains
a lot. Don’t be afraid. Though I don’t
know what you are going to do, Nan. I’m
not able to get out of bed, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“I’ll manage all right,” Nan said, though
her heart was sinking with all the troubles
that seemed flocking around. “I’ll make you
some coffee, as I do when mother has a headache.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can, my dear?” asked
Aunt Sallie. “I’m so sorry I’m laid up with
this lumbago!”</p>

<p>“I can manage,” replied Nan bravely, while
she hurried with her dressing. “We children
will just have to keep house by ourselves in
real earnest,” she said to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Nan was helping Flossie dress, and then
she intended to hurry down to the kitchen to
make coffee. Nan could get up a simple
breakfast, her mother and Dinah having
taught her this. But as Nan fastened Flossie’s
buttons she heard Bert moving around
in his room.</p>

<p>“Whoop-ee!” yelled the boy as he danced
around his apartment. “Oh, look, Freddie!
It’s snowing like anything! It’s a regular
blizzard!”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me see!” begged the small Bobbsey
lad.</p>

<p>“Don’t run around barefooted!” warned
Nan from her room. “I don’t want you
catching cold, Freddie, for then I’ll have
some one else sick to nurse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is Flossie sick?” called Bert who, having
looked from the window to see that it was
snowing hard, had now begun to dress. “Is
Flossie sick?” he called again.</p>

<p>“No. It’s Mrs. Pry,” Nan answered. “She
has the lumbago in her back, and I’ll have to
stay home from school and nurse her. You
and Flossie and Freddie can go, Bert—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
is, if the storm isn’t too bad. But you’ll have
to hurry. We’re late!”</p>

<p>“Late! I should say we were late!” cried
Bert as he looked at a clock on his bureau.
“It’s after half past eight and——”</p>

<p>Just then, above the noise of the swirling
snowflakes hitting against the windows and
the sound of the howling, cold wind, another
noise came to the ears of the Bobbsey twins.</p>

<p>A bell rang out in the distance. Five
strokes were sounded, then a pause and five
strokes more. Another pause, then another
five strokes.</p>

<p>“It’s the storm signal on the school bell!”
cried Bert. “The three fives! Hurray, no
school to-day!”</p>

<p>He danced around the room, half dressed.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked careful Nan.</p>

<p>“Sure!” answered Bert. “There it goes
again!”</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it this time. Fifteen
strokes rang out, five strokes at a time.
It was the signal Mr. Tarton had told the
children to listen for in case of a storm. And
this surely was a storm! The wind blew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
harder and the swirling, white flakes came
down more thickly.</p>

<p>“No school! No school!” sang Freddie as
he began to dress.</p>

<p>“No school! No school!” echoed Flossie,
as she followed Nan to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Hush, my dears, not so much racket!”
begged Nan in a low voice. “Mrs. Pry is
sick, and she may not like noise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not fussy that way,” said the old
lady who, in spite of her deafness, seemed to
have heard what Nan said. “Don’t keep the
children quiet on my account. And you’ll
have to hurry, Nan, or they’ll be late for
school.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any school,” Nan said.</p>

<p>“What’s that—some one fell over a stool?”
cried Mrs. Pry. “Oh, dear! And me flat on
my back with lumbago! Who fell over the
stool, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Nobody,” answered the Bobbsey girl. “I
said there was no school!”</p>

<p>“Oh! No school! You mustn’t mumble
your words, my dear. I can hear every time
if you speak out. No school, eh? I’m glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of that, for if there was, you’d be late and
on account of me. Oh, dear, I wish I could
be around to help with the work!”</p>

<p>“We’ll do the work, Aunt Sallie,” said Nan
kindly. “Don’t you worry or fuss. Just
stay in bed and keep warm, and I’ll bring you
up some breakfast. Would you like a hot
flatiron for your back?”</p>

<p>“Well, it would help the misery a lot,” the
old lady answered. “But I don’t like to be
such a bother.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t any bother at all,” said Nan
kindly. “Bert will help me get breakfast,
won’t you, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” he answered, sliding down the banister
rail. “But I’ve got to shovel the walks
of snow.”</p>

<p>“They can wait,” said Nan. “There’s no
use shoveling walks until it stops snowing.”</p>

<p>“I guess maybe that’s right,” agreed her
brother. “Say, it’s a big storm,” he cried, as
he saw how much snow had fallen in the
night. “I hope father and mother are all
right—and Sam and Dinah, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, so do I,” agreed Nan. “And I hope
some mail comes in to-day. I’d love to have
a letter from mother.”</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie crowded eagerly to the
windows to look out at the storm. The house
was snug and warm, but outside it was cold
and blowy, and though the small twins did
not mind snow or cold weather they were
just as glad, this morning, that they did not
have to tramp out to school.</p>

<p>Nan had often watched her mother and
Dinah get breakfast, and so had Bert, so together
the two older Bobbsey twins soon had
coffee boiling on the stove, and the oatmeal
which had been made ready the night before
was being warmed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to fry me some bacon!” declared
Bert.</p>

<p>“Do you know how?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Sure I do,” he declared. “Once Charlie
Mason and I made a fire in the woods and
fried bacon. It was good, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, first I wish you’d get some oranges
out of the pantry for Flossie and Freddie,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
said Nan. “Do that while I’m taking Mrs.
Pry up this hot coffee,” she added, as she
filled a cup with the steaming drink and put
some slices of bread and butter on a tray.</p>

<p>“All right—the oranges will be ready in a
minute,” laughed Bert. “First call for breakfast!
First call for breakfast!” he shouted,
as he had heard the waiters in the dining car
announce as they came into the Pullman
coaches on the railroad.</p>

<p>“It’s fun being snowed-in like this, isn’t it,
Flossie?” asked Freddie, as he tried to see
how flat he could make his nose by pressing it
against the window.</p>

<p>“Lots of fun,” agreed the little girl. “But
I’m hungry. I want my breakfast, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Bert will give you your oranges now,”
Nan answered. “And I’ll dish out your oatmeal
when I come down after I take Mrs.
Pry her coffee.”</p>

<p>This satisfied the smaller twins, and they
laughed at the funny faces Bert made as he
went about, pretending he was a Pullman
waiter. In fact Freddie laughed so hard
that some of his orange went down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
“wrong throat” and Bert had to pat his
small brother on the back to stop the
choking.</p>

<p>Nan carried the coffee into Aunt Sallie’s
room. Mrs. Pry had not gotten out of bed
and the shades were drawn down over the
windows.</p>

<p>“Shall I make it lighter for you?” asked
Nan. “It’s snowing again.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? You say the pig is out of
the pen? Land sakes, child, I didn’t know
you kept a pig! Dear me, and Sam isn’t here
to chase him back into the pen! Oh, the
misery in my back! If it wasn’t for the lumbago
I’d get after the pig!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about a pig or a
pen,” answered Nan, trying not to laugh.
“I said it was <em>snowing again</em>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, snowing again,” Mrs. Pry remarked.
“Well, why didn’t you say so at first, my
dear? Dear me! We’re having a lot of snow
this winter, and early, too. That’s right;
raise the curtains so I can see out. And
thank you for the coffee. Ah, it makes me
feel better,” she said, as she sipped it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Is it all right and strong enough?” asked
Nan.</p>

<p>“Plenty strong, and very good, my dear.
You’re quite a little housekeeper.”</p>

<p>Nan thought that she would need to be,
and so would Bert, if they were to be left
alone with a sick woman to look after. But
Nan said nothing about this.</p>

<p>She helped Mrs. Pry sit up in bed, for the
old lady could hardly raise herself on account
of the pain in her back. Nan propped the
pillows up against her, and then started
downstairs to get the hot flatiron, leaving
Mrs. Pry sipping the coffee and eating the
bread and butter.</p>

<p>As Nan started down she heard the shrill
voices of Flossie and Freddie, and she heard
Bert calling:</p>

<p>“Come back in here! Come right back in,
you little tykes!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what are they doing now?” thought
poor Nan.</p>

<h3>SNOWED IN</h3>


<p>Nan Bobbsey was glad her brother Bert
was at home, helping her keep house. Without
Bert she felt that she never could look
after things, see to Flossie and Freddie and
nurse the sick Mrs. Pry. And when Nan
heard her small brother and sister squealing
this way, which always meant mischief of
some sort or other, she was more than glad
that she also heard Bert’s voice calling to the
small twins.</p>

<p>Nan got to the foot of the stairs in time to
see Bert running out of a side door after Flossie
and Freddie who, bare-headed and with
no wraps on, had run out into the storm.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t do that!” exclaimed Nan.
“Bring them in, Bert!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m trying to do,” he answered,
but he could not help laughing, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
jolly and full of fun were Flossie and Freddie,
though they were also full of mischief.</p>

<p>“Now, I have you!” cried Bert as he caught
Flossie before she had time to get very far
away from the bottom of the steps.</p>

<p>“But you haven’t got me!” shouted Freddie,
making a dash through the piles of snow
on the ground and also through the cloud of
swirling flakes falling from the sky. “You
haven’t got me!”</p>

<p>“But I will get you!” shouted Bert. “Here,
Nan,” he called to his older sister, “you hold
this little tyke while I chase after this Freddie
boy!”</p>

<p>Nan, with a sigh and yet with a little laugh,
held Flossie, who, truth to tell, was herself
laughing and giggling so hard at the trick she
and Freddie had played on Bert that she
could not have run much farther, no matter
how much she wanted to.</p>

<p>Freddie had counted on Bert having to
drag Flossie along with him on the second
part of the chase. But when Bert turned
Flossie over to Nan, that left him free to run,
and he caught his small brother before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
latter had taken more than half a dozen steps.</p>

<p>“Prisoner number two!” cried Bert, picking
Freddie up in his arms and carrying him back
to the house. “Lock ’em up, Nan!”</p>

<p>“I shall have to, if they aren’t better,” Nan
said, with a shake of her head as she put Flossie
down in the hall while Bert did the same
with Freddie.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” suddenly cried Bert, as
he locked the door out of which the mischievous
ones had darted. He saw Freddie making
a sly attempt to open it again.</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Nan. “I was
coming down to get the flatiron for Aunt
Sallie and I heard the children scream.”</p>

<p>“They were only yelling for fun and because
they played a trick on me,” laughed
Bert. “They wanted to go out and get some
snow, but I wouldn’t let them.”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” agreed Nan. “The idea!”</p>

<p>“But we got out, anyhow, didn’t we, Flossie?”
laughed Freddie.</p>

<p>“Yes, we did!” she giggled.</p>

<p>“I went to the front door to see if the man
had left the milk,” explained Bert, “for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
leaves it on the front steps when it storms
too much to come around to the back. And
when I opened the door these two prisoners,”
and laughingly he shook a finger at them,
“wanted to go out and get some snow to bring
in the house.</p>

<p>“I said they couldn’t, and I only had time
to get the door shut to keep them in. Then
I went to the side door, leaving them trying
to unlock the front door, which they couldn’t
do, because I took the key out,” and with another
laugh Bert held up the key. “But all
of a sudden they crawled past me while I
was looking on the side porch for the milk,
and that’s how they got out. I had to run
after them.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering what happened,” said
Nan. “Did you bring the milk in, Bert?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t Nan. There isn’t any
milk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t the milkman come?”</p>

<p>“Guess he didn’t,” Bert answered. “It
isn’t the first time he’s missed us in a storm.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we have enough left for to-day,”
said Nan. “I’m pretty sure there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
bottle in the pantry. But if he doesn’t leave
any to-morrow, Bert, you’ll have to go after
some. But I guess the storm will stop by
then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Bert, while again he
shook his finger at Flossie and Freddie who
were laughing together in a corner, plotting
more tricks, it is likely. “It looks as if it’s
going to snow for a week, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope it doesn’t do that!” she cried.
“Mother and father would never get home
and we’ll never have any word from them.”</p>

<p>“I guess there’d be some way out,” answered
Bert. “But I don’t believe there’ll
be any mail delivered to-day. I could go
down to the post-office after it, though.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want you to go out in the
storm!” objected Nan. “I don’t want to be
left here all alone, with Mrs. Pry sick. Maybe
you couldn’t get back.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay with you,” promised her brother
good-naturedly. “But is Aunt Sallie very
sick?”</p>

<p>“Well, she has lots of pain in her back,”
explained Nan. “That’s why I’m going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
take her the hot flatiron. Then I must wash
the dishes and see about getting lunch.”</p>

<p>“Could we play picnic and make believe
take our lunch to the woods to eat?” asked
Flossie.</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be lots of fun!” cried
Freddie. “We could make believe up in the
attic was woods. Let’s do that!”</p>

<p>“I’ll see about it,” answered Nan. “Now
you look after them a little while, Bert, and
I’ll take this iron to Aunt Sallie. And don’t
you two little tykes dare to run out in the
snow again!”</p>

<p>“We won’t,” promised Flossie.</p>

<p>Nan found the old lady moving restlessly
about in bed with the pain of the lumbago
in her back.</p>

<p>“Do you think I ought to get the doctor
for you?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, dearie, I’ll be all right in a day
or so,” answered Mrs. Pry. “This hot iron
will help a lot. Then if I had some of my
liniment to rub on my back, I’d feel better.”</p>

<p>“Shall I get Bert to go to the drug store
after the liniment?” asked Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“You won’t need to do that, dearie,” answered
Mrs. Pry. “I have some of the stuff
in a bottle in my valise. If you’ll hand it to
me I’ll rub it on my back, and then I’ll go to
sleep awhile. I didn’t sleep much all night.
But I fell asleep toward morning, and I slept
so hard I didn’t wake up in time to call you
to go to school.”</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t any school, so that didn’t
matter,” Nan said.</p>

<p>She found the bottle of queer-smelling liniment
in the old lady’s valise, and gave it to
her. Then Nan said:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go down now and wash the
dishes.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Mrs. Pry. “You
say Bert is going out and try to catch some
fishes? Land sakes, child! he never can
catch any fishes in this snow storm! Don’t
let him go! Besides, I don’t like fish, anyhow!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about fishes!” replied
Nan in louder tones. “I said I was
going to wash the <em>dishes</em>!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Dishes!” murmured Mrs. Pry. “Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
my hearing isn’t what it once was. But I
surely thought you said fishes.”</p>

<p>Holding back her merriment, Nan went
downstairs. Flossie and Freddie were so
filled with joy over their plan of going up
in the attic and playing they were on a picnic
in the woods that they had become very
good and quiet indeed, making no trouble for
Bert, who had “picked up” the dishes, ready
for washing.</p>

<p>“I’ll dry them for you,” he told Nan, and
he added: “We might as well give Flossie
and Freddie some crackers and cookies, and
let them play up in the attic where they won’t
bother Aunt Sallie. They’ve got to do something
to keep out of trouble, and they can’t
go out in the storm.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll do that,” decided Nan.</p>

<p>Accordingly, she put some odds and ends
of cookies, cakes and crackers in two boxes
and gave them to the smaller twins. Then
Flossie got one of her dolls and Freddie took
a little iron fire-engine, one of his favorite
toys, and the small twins went up to the attic.
Nan went up with them and remained a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
while, to be sure it was warm enough for
them.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep up a good fire,” Bert had promised,
and he was as good as his word, for the
attic was as “warm as toast.” Bert knew
how to put coal on the furnace, and though
he could not toss on quite as big shovelfuls as
could Sam, who always looked after the
heater, Bert did very well.</p>

<p>With the small twins thus out of the way
for a while and with Mrs. Pry feeling better
because of the hot flatiron and the liniment,
Nan and Bert had a chance to do some of
the housework.</p>

<p>“How do you like keeping house, Nan?”
asked Bert, as he dried the cups and saucers.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s fun, but it’s a little bit lonesome,”
she answered.</p>

<p>“I feel that way, too,” Bert said. “If Dinah
and Sam were here it wouldn’t be so lonesome.
But with them gone, and daddy and
mother away, it isn’t so nice. But we’ve got
to stick it out, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Of course we have,” she said. “I wonder
what I had better cook for lunch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“Bacon,” quickly answered Bert.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed his sister. “You’d
have bacon three times a day, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s what fellows always have in
camp, and this is like camp,” Bert explained.</p>

<p>“It is, a little,” agreed Nan. “My, how
the snow keeps up!”</p>

<p>“And the wind, too!” added Bert as a sudden
gust howled around the corner of the
house, sending the hard snowflakes rattling
against the windows.</p>

<p>With Bert to help her, Nan tidied the
rooms and set the house to rights. Then she
looked in the pantry and saw that they had
enough food for another day. She caught
sight of a package of prepared flour, out of
which she had often seen Dinah make griddle
cakes.</p>

<p>“We’ll have griddle cakes and maple syrup
for lunch,” decided Nan.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” cried Bert. “That’s better than
bacon. But can you bake griddle cakes,
Nan?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Let me turn them for you,” begged Bert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll see,” was all Nan would promise.</p>

<p>It was shortly before noon that Nan went
to the side door to look out and see if, by
any chance, the belated milkman had been
along. But the door would not open, though
Nan tugged at it. Then, looking from a side
window, she saw that a big drift of snow had
piled up on the steps against the door, to
which, as well as to the door jambs, the snow
had frozen.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, we’re snowed-in!” cried Nan.
“We’re snowed-in, Bert!”</p>

<p>Bert came running from the kitchen at the
sound of his sister’s voice. At the same time,
up in the attic sounded loud shouts from
Flossie and Freddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, what else has happened?” wailed poor
Nan.</p>

</div>

<h3>NAN’S BISCUITS</h3>


<p>Bert Bobbsey at first thought something
had happened to Nan when he heard her call
out. But as he came in from the kitchen
and saw her standing safely by the door, he
asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing is the matter with me,” answered
Nan. “But the door is snowed fast. We
can’t get out.”</p>

<p>“We can go to another door then,” said
Bert, not much excited. “Once last winter
we couldn’t get the back door open because
a lot of snow had drifted against it, and we
had to use the front door. That’s nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it isn’t,” Nan agreed. “But
listen to that!”</p>

<p>She pointed upward, and Bert heard Flossie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
and Freddie in the attic screaming and
shouting.</p>

<p>“Those tykes again!” Bert cried with a
laugh as he started for the stairs. “I’ll fix
’em!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, you’ll have to be kind to them!”
pleaded Nan. “If you’re cross and they start
crying, they’ll want daddy and mother and
then we can’t do a thing with them! And
there’s so much trouble now, with Aunt Sallie
in bed. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” replied Bert. “I’ll be kind
to ’em, all right. I guess Freddie is just teasing
Flossie. She always yells when he teases
her. Don’t worry, Nan. Everything will be
all right.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” sighed Nan.</p>

<p>“And I’ll get a shovel and clear that snow
away from the door when I see what’s the
matter with those two tykes,” went on Bert,
as he hastened upstairs. He liked to call his
small brother and sister by the funny name
of “tykes,” which means a mischievous little
person.</p>

<p>Hurrying up to the attic, Bert found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
cause of the trouble. Flossie and Freddie,
tired of playing picnic in the “woods,” had
started a circus game, each one pretending to
be an animal. When Bert got up there he
saw Flossie lying on the floor with one foot
and leg thrust through the lower part of a
chair. Freddie was pulling his sister by the
arms, and as her leg was caught between the
chair rounds, she could not get loose. The
chair was being dragged along with Flossie.
She was crying and Freddie was shouting.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What’s the matter?”
called Bert. “Stop this kind of play!”</p>

<p>“This isn’t play,” Freddie explained. “We
were playing, but Flossie got her foot caught
and she couldn’t get it out and I can’t pull it
out!”</p>

<p>“And it hurts me!” sobbed Flossie. “Oh,
Bert, have I got to stay here forever?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” answered Bert. “I’ll soon
have you loose. Stop pulling, Freddie.
You’ll only jam her foot in tighter. Let go!”</p>

<p>Freddie let go of Flossie’s arms and then,
as she lay on the floor, Bert turned her foot
a little way around, so that it was crossways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
with the chair rounds, instead of up and
down against them, and a moment later Flossie
was free.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” laughed Bert, when he saw
that his sister was not hurt, though she still
sobbed, “it sounded like a den of wild animals
up here!”</p>

<p>“I was a wild lion,” explained Freddie.</p>

<p>“And I was an elephant,” said Flossie.
“Freddie said I must be a bad elephant and
kick the old chair over. So I kicked and my
foot went in and I couldn’t get it out again.”</p>

<p>“I pulled her and pulled her, but it didn’t
do any good,” explained Freddie.</p>

<p>“I should say not—the way you were pulling!”
laughed Bert. “But I guess you’ve had
enough of playing up here. Come on downstairs.
You must have frightened Aunt Sallie
out of her wits, banging around the way
you did and yelling.”</p>

<p>“Could we see Aunt Sallie?” asked Flossie,
as she and her brother followed Bert down
the attic stairs.</p>

<p>“I guess so, if she isn’t asleep,” said Bert.
“I’ll look in her room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>When he did so he found the old lady sitting
up in bed. She smiled at Bert and said:</p>

<p>“Are there any birds up in the attic? Seems
to me, Bert, I heard birds fluttering around
up there.”</p>

<p>The noise made by Flossie and Freddie had
been very loud, so loud that Nan had heard
it away downstairs. But the deaf old lady
had thought it was only the twittering of
birds. Bert wanted to laugh, but he did not.
He just said:</p>

<p>“No, there weren’t any birds, Aunt Sallie.
It was just Flossie and Freddie playing with
a chair.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you say Flossie cut Freddie’s hair?
She shouldn’t do that! She might cut him
or herself with the scissors. Besides, she is
such a little girl she can’t cut his hair
straight. Flossie shouldn’t cut hair. Moreover,
I never knew that hair-cutting made so
much noise.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” explained Bert. “Nobody was
cutting <em>hair</em>. I said Flossie and Freddie were
playing with a <em>chair</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! Chair!” repeated Mrs. Pry. “You
should speak a little more plainly, Bert, my
dear. Don’t mumble your words. But how
are Flossie and Freddie, anyhow? I haven’t
seen them all day.”</p>

<p>“They’re out in the hall now,” explained
Bert. “They’d like to see you if you’re not
too sick.”</p>

<p>“Bring them in, Bert. I’m feeling a little
better now. Nan is a good nurse. The hot
flatiron she brought me helped the lumbago
in my back. Bring the children in.”</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie looked curiously at
Aunt Sallie. They had never before seen her
in bed, and as she sat up, propped against the
pillows with a blanket around her and a cap
on her head, Flossie exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, you look just like the pictures of little
Red Riding Hood’s grandmother!”</p>

<p>“Do I, my dear?” asked the old lady.
“Well, if I’m the grandmother, the lumbago
in my back must be the wolf. Not a real
wolf,” she added. “Just make believe, you
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“I know,” said Freddie. “I was playing I
was a lion up in the attic.”</p>

<p>“And I was an elephant,” explained Flossie.
“And I got my foot caught in a chair
and I couldn’t get it out!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re all right now,” said the old
lady, with a smile. “Be good children now,
for you’ll have to help Nan and Bert keep
house until I get better. It’s a sad time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we like it,” laughed Freddie. “We
can stay at home and don’t have to go to
school.”</p>

<p>“You say somebody lost his mule?” asked
Mrs. Pry. “That’s too bad! The mule was
lost in the storm, I expect.”</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie looked at each other
wonderingly, and then at Bert. They were
not quite so used to the misunderstandings of
the old lady as were Bert and Nan. So Bert,
before his brother and sister should laugh at
Mrs. Pry, made haste to say:</p>

<p>“They didn’t say anything about a mule,
Aunt Sallie. Freddie said he was glad there
wasn’t any school!”</p>

<p>“Oh, school! Yes! Well, there’s no sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
in going to school when its such a bad storm.
But I guess it will soon stop!”</p>

<p>However, it did not soon stop. The small
Bobbsey twins went downstairs from Mrs.
Pry’s room, and the snow was still falling and
the wind was still blowing. Not that the little
twins minded this—they liked it all the
more, snug and warm as they were in the
house.</p>

<p>But Nan, getting the lunch and putting another
flatiron on to heat for Mrs. Pry’s back,
shook her head more than once as she looked
out of the window.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bert as he noticed
how serious his twin sister seemed.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to get worried about
mother and daddy,” answered Nan. “I
don’t see why we haven’t had some word from
them—a letter or a post card.”</p>

<p>“I guess the mails are late on account of
the storm,” Bert remarked. “If we don’t get
any to-day, and I guess we won’t, for I
haven’t heard the postman’s whistle, to-morrow
I’ll go down to the post-office and ask
if there are any letters for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t go if it storms this way,” Nan
said.</p>

<p>“It will stop by to-morrow,” declared Bert.</p>

<p>With her brother’s help Nan managed to
get up a nice little lunch for the family, consisting
of some baked potatoes, an omelet,
and some bread and preserves. She made
toast for Mrs. Pry and took it up to her with
a cup of hot tea. Flossie and Freddie begged
to be allowed to help, so Nan let them carry
the toast—each one had a slice wrapped in a
napkin.</p>

<p>“They can’t hurt the toast, even if they
drop it,” Nan whispered to Bert. But the
small twins were very careful, and the toast
arrived safely in the invalid’s room.</p>

<p>“You are very good to me, Nan,” sighed
Aunt Sallie. “I think I will try and get
around to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“No, you must stay in bed until your
lumbago is all gone,” insisted Nan. “I’ll
bring you up another hot iron as soon as you
take your toast and tea.”</p>

<p>“Yes, heat is the best thing for lumbago,”
said Mrs. Pry. “That and my liniment will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
cure me, I expect. But my liniment is nearly
gone. And how to get more I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Bert will get it for you,” offered Nan
kindly.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed. Bert got out on the
porch in his big coat and rubber boots and
cleared away some of the snow. Flossie and
Freddie wanted to go out with him, but Nan
would not allow this. She got the smaller
twins into a room where they could not see
Bert at work with the snow shovel, and told
them stories.</p>

<p>“How is it outside, Bert?” asked Nan when
her brother came in, having cleared the side
door against which the big drift had blown.</p>

<p>“Pretty bad,” he answered. “It seems to
snow harder than ever, and the wind is blowing
and it’s getting colder. I’m glad we’re
inside with a warm fire and plenty to eat.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the trouble,” said Nan in a
low voice. “We haven’t plenty to eat, Bert.”</p>

<p>“Not enough to eat—what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean we haven’t any bread. I
toasted the last of it for Mrs. Pry. There’s
no bread for supper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll go to the store and get a loaf,” Bert
offered.</p>

<p>“No!” cried his sister quickly. “I don’t
want you to go out in the storm. You might
get lost!”</p>

<p>“But what’ll we do for supper?” asked Bert.
“I’ve got to have bread and butter.”</p>

<p>“We have plenty of butter,” explained Nan.
“I’ll make a batch of biscuits,” she added.
“They’re as good as bread.”</p>

<p>“Better!” declared Bert. “But can you
make biscuits, Nan?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Mother’s told me how and
I’ve watched Dinah make them lots of times.
You just mix up some flour, milk, baking
powder, water and lard and roll it out and
then cut the biscuits into round shapes and
put them in a pan and bake them in the
oven.”</p>

<p>“It sounds easy,” remarked Bert. “I’ll
help you.”</p>

<p>When Flossie and Freddie heard what Nan
was going to do, they, also, wanted to help.</p>

<p>“We can’t all do it,” laughed Nan. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
you can come in the kitchen and watch me.”</p>

<p>“Can I have some sugar on my bikset when
it’s baked?” asked Flossie.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Freddie. “Listen to
what she called ’em! Bikset! Bikset!”</p>

<p>“That’s their name,” insisted Flossie.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t!” cried Freddie. “It’s buskit!
Guess I know!”</p>

<p>“You’re both wrong!” laughed Bert. “But
no matter how you call them, they’re going to
be good when Nan bakes them. Now you
two sit down in chairs where you’ll be out of
the way.”</p>

<p>Nan told Bert what to bring her from the
pantry so she could make the biscuits, and
then, putting on an apron and rolling up her
sleeves, she began.</p>

<p>As she had seen Dinah do, she mixed the
flour and lard together first, kneading it with
her hands.</p>

<p>“It’s just like making mud pies,” said Freddie.</p>

<p>“’Cept it isn’t brown mud—it’s white,” said
Flossie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“I wish I could squeeze ’em like that,”
went on Freddie, as he saw Nan working up
the dough.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t, so just you sit still!” Nan
told him, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Remembering what her mother had told
her, and what she had seen Dinah do, Nan
soon had rolled the biscuit dough out on the
floured board, and then with a shiny tin
thing, she cut out little round, flattened bits
of dough, which she put in a buttered pan,
ready for the oven.</p>

<p>“I’ve got enough dough for two pans of
biscuits,” said the little cook. “So I’ll set
this first pan down in a chair and get another
pan ready for the oven. Then they’ll both
bake at the same time.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have lots of buskits!” said Freddie.
“I’m glad, because I like buskits!”</p>

<p>“And I’m going to have sugar on my bikset,
ain’t I, Nan?” asked Flossie.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” said the young cook, giving all
her attention to cutting out the second batch.</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie both liked to watch
this part of the work, so they left their chairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
to stand beside the table. They stood on
their tiptoes, so eager were they.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll put these in the pan, and pop
them into the oven,” said Nan, when the last
of the biscuits had been cut out. “Sit down
in your chairs, Flossie and Freddie, so you
won’t be in my way when I open the oven
door.”</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie went back to where
they had been sitting, and all would have
been well if Flossie had taken the same chair
out of which she had slid a little while before
to watch Nan. But, instead, Flossie backed
up to the wrong chair.</p>

<p>It was the chair on which Nan had set the
first pan of biscuits, and a moment later Flossie
“plopped” herself down right on top of the
soft bits of dough!</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” yelled Freddie, but too late.
“Look! Look! Flossie sat on the buskits!
Flossie’s sitting on the buskits!”</p>

</div>

<h3>BROKEN WIRES</h3>


<p>Nan jumped so, because of Freddie’s shouts
and Flossie’s screams, that she almost dropped
the batch of biscuits she was just then
putting into the oven. But she managed to
get them in and close the door. Then she
turned and said to Freddie:</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t fool me that way! Oh, how
you startled me!”</p>

<p>“He isn’t fooling you,” said Bert. “Flossie
did really sit in the biscuits!”</p>

<p>By this time the little girl herself had come
to know that something was wrong. She
felt something soft in the chair where she had
been sitting—something soft with a hard rim
around it that had not been in it when she
got up to watch Nan use the biscuit-cutter.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” screamed Flossie. “What is
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t yell so. You aren’t hurt!” said
Nan.</p>

<p>“But the buskits are hurt!” yelled Freddie.
“They’re all squashed flat! Look at ’em!”</p>

<p>This was quite true—Flossie had sat down
rather hard on the biscuits and they were
“squashed,” as Freddie said.</p>

<p>“But you can roll ’em out again, Nan,”
suggested Bert. “They aren’t spoiled. Flossie’s
dress is clean—I mean it was clean before
she sat in the biscuits.”</p>

<p>“Is my dress—now—is it dirty?” asked
Flossie, trying to turn herself around to look
at the back of her garment.</p>

<p>“It’s all sticky dough and flour,” stated
Freddie. “You look like a buskit yourself,
Flossie!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed the little girl, and she
would have burst into tears but for Nan, who
put her arms about her and kindly said:</p>

<p>“Never mind. Your dress will wash and
the biscuits aren’t hurt much. I can roll
them out again, and I’ll give you two with
sugar on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” agreed Flossie, and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
face brightened. Then, as Freddie said, she
“squeezed back” her tears, and they all
laughed at the funny accident.</p>

<p>Bert picked most of the dough off Flossie’s
dress while Nan took the “squashed” biscuits
from the pan, rolled the dough out again on
the moulding board, and made that batch
over. Soon they were baking in the oven
with the others.</p>

<p>“They smell good!” declared Freddie, when
his sister opened the oven door to see how the
biscuits were browning.</p>

<p>“They’ll taste a lot better,” laughed Bert,
while Nan took Flossie upstairs to put a clean
dress on her.</p>

<p>In spite of the accident, Nan’s biscuits
turned out very well, only a few of them being
burned, and the children ate many of
them for supper.</p>

<p>“Has Dinah come back?” asked Mrs. Pry,
when Nan took her up a tray with her supper
on it.</p>

<p>“Dinah come back? No, what makes you
ask that?” inquired Nan, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, I see you have hot biscuits,” went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
on Mrs. Pry, with twinkles in her eyes, “and
I thought Dinah had come back to make
them.”</p>

<p>“No, I did it!” exclaimed Nan, and she
felt very proud that Mrs. Pry should think
the biscuits as good as those which Dinah
could make.</p>

<p>“You made these biscuits! My, that’s
wonderful!” said Aunt Sallie, tasting one.
“You are certainly a good little housekeeper.”</p>

<p>This pleased Nan more than ever and the
lonesome feeling that was coming over her
again, as night began to fall, seemed to pass
away for a time.</p>

<p>After supper, or dinner, as it was called
when Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey were at home,
Bert and Nan washed and dried the dishes.
Flossie begged so hard to be allowed to help
that Nan let her dry a few.</p>

<p>“But you must be careful and not drop
any, or they’ll break,” cautioned Nan.</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” promised Flossie.</p>

<p>But alas! She was wiping a saucer when
Freddie, who was playing on the floor with
his train of cars, made a sudden movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Flossie. “Don’t jiggle
me!”</p>

<p>But her small brother must have “jiggled”
her, or done something, for the saucer slipped
from Flossie’s hands.</p>

<p>Crash! It fell to the floor, breaking into
half a dozen pieces.</p>

<p>For a moment Flossie stood there, looking
at it with open mouth. Then as she realized
what had happened she burst into tears and
gasped:</p>

<p>“Freddie made me do it! That’s all your
fault, Freddie Bobbsey. It’s your fault!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t!” cried Freddie. “I wasn’t
wiping the dish!”</p>

<p>“But you—you—now—you jiggled me!”
sobbed Flossie.</p>

<p>“That’s what he did,” declared Bert, who
had seen what had happened.</p>

<p>“Never mind, my dear!” soothed Nan. “It
was an old saucer anyhow, and it was
cracked.”</p>

<p>“Was—was it?” faltered Flossie.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was,” Nan replied, and this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
true. It was an old dish which had had a
fall before. But this was the end of it.
“Dinah often said she was going to throw
that old saucer away,” went on Nan. “Now
I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>It made Flossie feel better to know that she
had not broken a good dish. So she dried
her tears. But Nan decided that she would
take no more chances with letting the little
girl dry dishes.</p>

<p>“You two go in the other room with Bert
and pop corn,” she suggested, looking straight
at Bert to tell him to get the small twins out
of the way. “I’ll finish the dishes,” Nan
whispered to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, pop corn! Pop corn!” cried Freddie,
dancing around. “How I love pop corn!”</p>

<p>“So do I!” echoed Flossie. “I’m going to
have some pop corn, ain’t I?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Bert.</p>

<p>A little later, when Nan had finished the
dishes, she joined Bert and the small twins
in the living room, where Bert popped corn
over the gas log. Flossie and Freddie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
laughed as the kernels cracked with the heat,
bursting out into queerly shaped, big, white
objects.</p>

<p>“They look like crooked snowflakes,” was
Freddie’s comment.</p>

<p>“But they taste better’n snowflakes,” said
Flossie.</p>

<p>Bert wanted to melt some sugar and pour
over the corn, so he could make balls of it,
but Nan said this would be too sticky. So
they melted some butter, poured that into the
pan of popped corn, and then sprinkled on
some salt.</p>

<p>“Oh, <a id="yum"></a>yum! It’s good!” mumbled Bert as
he filled his mouth with the crisp corn.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Nan, “it is. And it would
be jolly fun here if only the storm would
stop.”</p>

<p>“It’s snowing yet,” remarked Bert as they
grew quiet a moment and listened to the
flakes striking against the windows.</p>

<p>Though the older Bobbsey twins were a
bit worried over keeping house all by themselves,
with Aunt Sallie Pry ill in bed, Flossie
and Freddie were not at all alarmed. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
a perpetual picnic for them, and they had so
much fun, playing about the room, eating
pop corn and playing they were sailors shipwrecked
on a desert island, and rushing to
door or window to see the storm that Nan
had hard work to get them to go to bed.</p>

<p>But at last they were tucked in, and then
Nan came down to sit for a while with Bert,
having first gone in to see if Mrs. Pry needed
anything.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get her some more liniment
in the morning, Bert,” Nan told her brother.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll go to the store,” he agreed. “I
don’t mind the snow.”</p>

<p>“Then you can bring in some bread,” added
Nan.</p>

<p>“And I’ll see if there is any mail for us at
the post-office,” added her brother.</p>

<p>The Bobbsey twins were rather surprised
the next morning when they looked out and
found that the storm had stopped. At least,
the snow had ceased falling, though a mass of
gray clouds in the sky seemed to tell of more
to come.</p>

<p>“I can get out to the store now!” cried Bert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
as he quickly dressed. “And I’ll get the
mail, too!”</p>

<p>“I’m coming with you!” shouted Freddie.</p>

<p>“So am I!” echoed Flossie.</p>

<p>“Not much, you aren’t!” exclaimed Bert.
“You’d freeze your ears off. It’s cold
out!”</p>

<p>He could tell this, even though he had not
been out of doors, by listening to the
“squeak” of the snow as wagons were drawn
along the street in front of the house. For
the snowfall had been so sudden that few
sleighs were out as yet.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want to freeze my ears,”
said Freddie.</p>

<p>“I don’t, either,” agreed Flossie. So they
no longer teased to be allowed to go out and
play.</p>

<p>Nan got breakfast and then gave Bert Mrs.
Pry’s liniment bottle to have filled at the
drug store. She also told her brother what to
bring from the store, besides bread. Then,
well wrapped up and wearing his rubber
boots, Bert started out. The snow was deep,
and it was cold, as he had said. But he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
not mind even though it took his breath to
plow through it.</p>

<p>He stopped in the drug store first, and
handed Mr. Renner the bottle to fill with
liniment.</p>

<p>“How’s everybody up at your house, Bert?”
asked the druggist.</p>

<p>“We’re all right—what there is of us,” Bert
answered. “My father and mother are
away, and so are Sam and Dinah. And Mrs.
Pry’s in bed with lumbago. The liniment is
for her.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” said Mr. Renner. “Winter
isn’t the best time to have lumbago—in
fact, I don’t know when it is a good time to
have it. Quite a storm we had. Lot of
trains stalled, wires down and all that, I
hear.”</p>

<p>“Trains stalled?” exclaimed Bert quickly.
“When?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that happened yesterday when the
storm was at its worst,” the druggist said,
and Bert felt easier, for he thought his mother
and father had reached Uncle Rossiter’s before
they could have been snowed-in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“And are the wires down?” Bert asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, a lot of telephone and telegraph
wires are broken. My telephone is out of
order and I don’t know when they’ll get it
fixed.”</p>

<p>Bert took the liniment and went on to the
post-office. There he found a number of
men gathered about the letter window. Mr.
Anderson, the postmaster, was speaking to
them and Bert listened.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any mail in—hasn’t been for
a couple of days,” said the postmaster. “I
don’t know when there will be any. A lot
of mail trains are stuck in the drifts. And
the wires are down to a lot of places so I can’t
get any word as to when the mail will arrive.
You’ll just have to wait—that’s all. Blame
it on the storm.”</p>

<p>Bert felt a sinking feeling around his heart.
Still he made up his mind he was going to ask
if there was any letter from his father or
mother.</p>

</div>

<h3>A GREAT CRASH</h3>


<p>Waiting until some of the men had moved
aside from the delivery window, Bert made
his way to it. Mr. Anderson knew the Bobbsey
boy, for in the summer Bert had often
gone to his father’s lumber office, and, more
than once, had been allowed to go down to
the post-office for the mail.</p>

<p>“No letters for the lumber company to-day,
Bert,” the postmaster said, with a smile.
“There were a couple yesterday, but Mr.
Jones got them.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come for the office mail, Mr. Anderson,”
explained the boy. “But the postman
hasn’t been at our house for two or three
days, and I thought maybe there’d be some
mail here for my sister or me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look, but I don’t believe there is any,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Bert,” said Mr. Anderson. “None of the men
went out yesterday, on account of the heavy
storm.”</p>

<p>He went back to the long table where the
mail was sorted, but when he again approached
the window there were no letters in
his hands.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Bert, nothing for you folks,” said
Mr. Anderson. “You see everything is upset.
The trains are late, and some are stuck in
deep snow up further north, I hear. And the
worst of it is that a lot of wires have been
blown down so we can’t get any word. Tell
your mother the man will go out with mail as
soon as any comes in.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell my mother that,” stated Bert.</p>

<p>“Why not? Is she sick?”</p>

<p>“No, but Mrs. Pry is. She came to keep
house for us while mother and dad went
away. Then she got sick, and Dinah and
Sam went away, and——”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me you Bobbsey
twins are keeping house all by yourselves!”
interrupted the postmaster in astonishment.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’re doing,” answered Bert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
“That’s why I wanted to get a letter—to hear
if my father and mother were all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they’re all right, Bert,” said
Mr. Anderson kindly when he had heard the
story of the trip Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey had
to take. “It’s only that the mails are late.
Probably your folks have written you, but
you won’t get the letters for a few days yet.”</p>

<p>“Nan and I wrote to them, telling about
Sam and Dinah going away,” explained Bert.
“But I guess our letters didn’t get to them,
either.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed the man at the letter window.
“I don’t believe they did. And you can’t
telegraph or telephone them, either, Bert, on
account of the wires being down. But I guess
things will be better in a few days.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured Bert, as he turned
away from the window. Others were coming
in to make inquiries. “Nan will feel sad
about not getting a letter,” thought the boy.</p>

<p>However, there was nothing he could do.
So he left the post-office and went to the store
to get the things Nan had said were needed—a
loaf of bread, some condensed milk—since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the milkman had left no bottles—and half a
dozen other things.</p>

<p>Now that the snow had stopped, at least
for a time, the streets of Lakeport were filling
with people who had not been able to get out
of their houses during the storm. Many
others besides the Bobbsey twins needed to
buy things to eat.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got quite a bundle to carry,
Bert,” remarked Mr. Fink, the grocer, as he
did up the things the boy had bought. “Think
you can manage it all?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” was the answer. “I’ve got to
get the stuff home. Don’t want to go hungry,
you know. And it looks as if it was
going to snow some more.”</p>

<p>On his way home with the bundle of food,
Bert saw Danny Rugg just ahead of him.
Danny also had his arms filled with bundles,
for he, too, had been to the store. Seeing
Bert, Danny stopped and grinned.</p>

<p>“Plenty of snow for a snowball fight now,”
Danny said.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any time to fight,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Bert, in no very friendly tones. He more
than half suspected Danny had suggested to
Sam the idea that Bert had broken the church
window.</p>

<p>“Aren’t mad, are you?” Danny wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Bert was going to answer and say he was
not exactly “mad” when Sam, coming along
the street, called to Danny and the latter
hastened off to join his crony.</p>

<p>“I’d just like to find out why you went into
the church that time I fell down the trapdoor,”
mused Bert, as he struggled along, for
it was hard going. “It had something to do
with the broken window, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>The wind was rising again and it was very
cold. The gale whipped snowflakes from the
ground into Bert’s face with stinging force.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll have another blizzard,” he
thought. “It sure does look like more snow,”
and he glanced up at the gray clouds.</p>

<p>Bert reached home at last and found Nan
trying to amuse Flossie and Freddie in the
house. It was hard work, for the small twins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
now that they could look out and see that the
fall of snow had stopped, at least for a time,
wanted to go outside and play in the drifts.</p>

<p>“I think it will be all right for them to
come out with me for a little while,” suggested
Bert, when he saw how Flossie and
Freddie were “pestering” Nan. “They can put
on their boots, dress warmly, and I’ll take
care of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right,” agreed Nan. “But they
mustn’t stay out too long. Mother wouldn’t
let them if she were here.” At the mention of
her absent mother Nan felt her eyes filling
with tears, so she quickly turned her head
away.</p>

<p>“Hurray! Hurray! We can go out!”
shouted Freddie, capering about the room
like a pony in a pasture.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to make snowballs!” declared
Flossie. “But don’t you dare wash
my face, Freddie Bobbsey!”</p>

<p>“All right, I won’t,” he promised, on his
good behaviour for a time, lest Nan change
her mind about letting him out.</p>

<p>“Did you get any letters from daddy or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
mother?” asked Nan, as Bert put his bundles
on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>“No mail, and the wires are down,” he
said. “But I guess we’ll get a letter to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” sighed Nan. “Did you get
Mrs. Pry’s liniment?”</p>

<p>“Yes, here it is.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you got it,” went on Nan.
“She’s asked for it two or three times. Her
lumbago seems to be getting worse.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll have to get the doctor for
her,” suggested Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not,” exclaimed Nan. “If she
got very sick, I don’t know how I could wait
on her and look after the house.”</p>

<p>“It would be hard,” agreed Bert. “But
maybe everything will be all right. Now I’ll
take Flossie and Freddie out for a while. It
will make them sleep better to-night to have
some fresh air.”</p>

<p>He and the small twins had some jolly fun
in the snow. Well wrapped up and with rubber
boots which kept their feet and legs dry,
Flossie and Freddie raced about, made snowballs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and tossed them to and fro, and even
began to make a snow man.</p>

<p>But it was so cold that the snow did not
pack well, or stick together. Snow must be
a trifle wet to roll big balls or build snow forts
and construct snow men to guard them.</p>

<p>However, Flossie and Freddie had lots of
fun, and Bert was a good brother. He let
them throw snowballs at him, though it must
be said that Flossie and Freddie did not hit
him often, for they could not throw very
straight. And when they did hit Bert the
balls did not hurt.</p>

<p>Then Bert pretended he was a horse and
raced about with them through the drifts
until the merry laughs of Flossie and Freddie
could be heard by Nan who was taking Mrs.
Pry up some more tea, toast, and preserves.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad they’re having a good
time,” sighed Nan. “They’ll be easier to
manage after they’ve had some fun.”</p>

<p>Poor Nan was not having much fun herself.
But she was a brave girl, and she knew
she and Bert must keep house until mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
and daddy returned, or at least until Sam or
Dinah got back.</p>

<p>No word had been received from either of
the faithful colored servants since they had
gone. But this would not have been surprising,
even if the mail trains had been running
since neither of them knew much about
writing letters.</p>

<p>Panting and laughing, with rosy-red cheeks,
Flossie and Freddie came into the house with
Bert, stamping and brushing the snow off
their feet on the side porch, from which Bert
had shoveled most of the big drift.</p>

<p>“Oh, we had lots of fun!” panted Freddie.</p>

<p>“Lots of fun!” echoed Flossie.</p>

<p>“We’re going out again after we eat,” went
on Freddie.</p>

<p>“I’ll see about that,” was all Nan would
promise.</p>

<p>And after she had given the small twins
something to eat and had gotten something
for herself and Bert, the latter, going to the
window, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It’s snowing again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>And so it was.</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t we go out?” cried Flossie.</p>

<p>“Just for a little while!” begged Freddie,
for they seemed to know that with the white
flakes again falling their outdoor fun would
end.</p>

<p>“I’ll take them out for just a little while,”
said Bert. “They’ll be easier to manage
when they get good and tired,” he whispered
to Nan.</p>

<p>So, once again, the small twins were
bundled up, and Bert took them out in the
snow. They played about for a time, but the
storm grew worse quickly, the wind being
cold and the snowflakes stinging the faces of
Flossie and Freddie, so that soon they were
glad to go in again.</p>

<p>Just as Bert had thought, letting Flossie
and Freddie play out of doors made the small
twins sleepy, and they were ready for bed
much earlier than usual that evening.</p>

<p>Bert and Nan were also tired, so about ten
o’clock the Bobbsey house was quiet and
dark, every one being in bed. The last thing
Bert remembered hearing was the howl of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
wind outside and the tinkle of snowflakes
against the windows.</p>

<p>“It’s storming hard again,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>And the first thing he heard, when he
awakened in the dim, gray light of morning,
was still the noise of the storm.</p>

<p>“It kept up all night,” thought Bert. “My,
but the snow will be deep! And how that
wind blows! It shakes the house!”</p>

<p>He was aware of a furious blast howling
outside. And really, at times, the house
trembled.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert!” called Nan from her room.
“Are you awake?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going to get right up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a terrible storm, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it’s pretty bad,” admitted
her brother. “But we’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than the wind howled
louder than ever, and to the ears of the Bobbsey
twins came the sound of a great crash.
It was the noise of breaking wood and shattered
glass.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Nan.</p>

</div>

<h3>BERT FALLS OFF</h3>


<p>Bert Bobbsey did not know what had
caused that crashing sound any more than
did Nan. For a few moments he was frightened,
as was his sister. Certainly that crash
was enough to scare any one, coming as it
did in the midst of the storm. And when you
take four children, none of them very old,
and put them in a house all alone, except for
Aunt Sallie Pry, ill in bed, there is some reason
for them to be afraid.</p>

<p>“Oh, what was it?” cried Nan again.
“There it goes some more!” she went on, as
the banging, crashing sound repeated itself.
“What is it, Bert?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he answered. “But I’ll
soon find out.”</p>

<p>By this time Flossie and Freddie had been
awakened. They, too, heard the terrifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
noise and the banging which jarred the house.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s Santa Claus coming down
the chimney,” suggested Flossie.</p>

<p>“It’s too early for Santa Claus,” called
Freddie as he quickly began to dress. “But
maybe it’s an airship, Bert, and it banged
into our chimney. It sounds like a chimney,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It sounds like almost anything,” Bert answered
as he made haste in putting on his
clothes.</p>

<p>In her room Aunt Sallie had caught the
word “chimney,” spoken by Flossie and Freddie,
but she had not heard what else the small
twins said. She did hear the banging sound,
however, and she called:</p>

<p>“Oh, Nan, what is it? Is the chimney on
fire? If it is, throw a lot of salt in the stove.
Salt will put out chimney fires,” which was
true enough, only the chimney was not blazing—at
least, Bert and Nan hoped it was not.</p>

<p>Nan answered the old lady, saying:</p>

<p>“We don’t know what it is, Aunt Sallie.
I don’t believe the chimney is on fire. Bert
is going to look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Bert dropped a book, did he?” exclaimed
Mrs. Pry. “Well, that’s all right—you
can’t help dropping things once in a
while, and you can’t break a book by dropping
it. But it must have been a very large
book to make so much noise.”</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” silently laughed Freddie as he
was dressing with his brother. “She thought
Nan said a book, but she said you were going
to look.”</p>

<p>“Don’t laugh,” whispered Bert. “Aunt
Sallie can’t help being deaf.”</p>

<p>And as they did not want to agitate the old
lady, neither Nan nor Bert told her that
something worse had happened than the mere
dropping of a book.</p>

<p>That some danger was at hand Nan and
Bert were very sure. The crashing, banging
sound kept up, and at times the whole house
shivered and shook, and it was not the wind
which was doing this, either.</p>

<p>“Bert, I am afraid!” whispered Nan, as she
and her brother met in the hall outside their
rooms. Flossie and Freddie had followed
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid,” Bert answered,
quite bravely for a boy of his size. “I’ll soon
see what it is.”</p>

<p>“Maybe somebody rolled a big snowball on
our stoop,” suggested Freddie.</p>

<p>“Or else a big icicle fell,” added Flossie
“Is it snowing yet, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s snowing hard, and the wind is
blowing. But, Bert,” she added, “I believe
Flossie and Freddie are right—the noise is
outside, it isn’t in the house.”</p>

<p>“It does sound outside,” Bert said. “Let’s
listen a minute.”</p>

<p>They stood quietly in the hall. Mrs. Pry,
believing it was a book that had fallen which
made the noise, was waiting patiently in bed
until Nan should bring her a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>And as the twins listened there came to
their ears that banging sound again, and this
time it clearly came from the front of the
house and not far from where they stood.
Mrs. Pry heard the noise too, and she must
have felt the house tremble.</p>

<p>“Is Bert dropping more books?” she called.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring your coffee right away,” Nan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
answered, thinking this was the best thing to
say, rather than to speak of their fears.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, I’ll feel better after some
coffee,” said the old lady.</p>

<p>“The noise comes from there,” and Nan
pointed, as she whispered, to the big front
“spare,” or guest, room of the house.</p>

<p>“I’ll go in and see what it is,” offered Bert.
“You shut Aunt Sallie’s door so she won’t
get nervous.”</p>

<p>It was well Nan did this, for as soon as
Bert opened the door of the guest bedroom,
out blew a blast of cold air, followed by a
cloud of snow. In a glance Nan, Bert and
the smaller twins saw what had happened.</p>

<p>A big branch from a tree in front of the
house had broken off and had crashed through
the front window of the bedroom, breaking
out all the glass. Through this opening the
cold wind was blowing the snow, until there
was a pile of the white flakes on the floor.
The limb was not broken entirely off the tree,
but hung by a few shreds of wood. It was as
though it was on a hinge, like a door, and
each time the wind blew the branch swayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
to and fro, banging against the side of the
house and on the porch roof, which extended
across the front of the house, and beneath
the guest-room windows.</p>

<p>“That’s what made the noise!” cried Freddie,
pointing.</p>

<p>“And look at the snow on the floor!” exclaimed
Flossie. “I’m going to make a snowball!”</p>

<p>“No you aren’t!” cried Nan, catching her
little sister by the arm as she was about to
dash into the room. “Oh, Bert, what are we
going to do?” Nan asked. “The window is
all smashed.”</p>

<p>“And maybe that branch will poke a hole
in the side of the house,” added Freddie, as
the wind, swaying the limb, banged it up
against the window frame. There was no
more glass left to break.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon fix this!” cried Bert. “I’ll get
a hatchet and chop the branch loose. Then
it won’t bang any more.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t put in a new window!”
said Nan.</p>

<p>“We can tack a blanket or something over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
it, and that will keep out the snow and wind,”
decided Bert. “I’ll get a hatchet!”</p>

<p>It seemed to be the only thing to do. For,
as Freddie had said, the branch, if left to
sway to and fro, would keep hitting against
the side of the house and might in time break
the clapboards and smash a hole through the
plaster.</p>

<p>“Can you chop that branch off?” asked
Nan, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Sure!” declared her brother. “I’ll just
get out on the porch roof, and I’ll soon cut
through that limb. It only hangs by a few
shreds. It’ll be easy.”</p>

<p>Nan saw what Bert meant to do. They
went a little way into the guest room, but it
was so cold, now that the window was
smashed, and the wind blew the snow about
with such swirling gusts that Nan thought the
small twins might catch cold.</p>

<p>“Come out and we’ll shut the door,” she
called, pulling Flossie and Freddie toward
her. “That will keep the rest of the house
from getting freezing cold until we can tack
a blanket over the window.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to help! Can’t I, Bert?” asked
Freddie.</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” was all Bert would promise.
“You go ahead and make the coffee for Aunt
Sallie, Nan, while I get the hatchet.”</p>

<p>“And I want my breakfast!” cried Flossie.</p>

<p>“So do I,” chimed in Freddie.</p>

<p>“Now, just go easy,” advised Nan. “I
can’t do everything at once. Oh, dear,” she
sighed, “so many things are happening! I
do wish mother and daddy would come
back!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get along all right,” replied Bert.
“This isn’t anything. ’Tisn’t half as bad as
if the chimney had fallen down, for then we
couldn’t have any fire.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not,” agreed Nan. “But
I’ll be glad when you get that limb chopped
off. Listen to it bang!”</p>

<p>As she spoke the wind suddenly whistled
around the house in a burst of freezing air,
howling and moaning, while the swaying tree
branch banged louder than ever.</p>

<p>“Nan! Bert! I’m sure that was the chimney
blowing down!” cried Aunt Sallie, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Nan had opened her door when they came out
of the cold guest chamber.</p>

<p>“No, it’s only a tree branch near the house
banging against the side,” Nan answered.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say? You’re going to
take the children for a ride? Oh, I wouldn’t
do that so early in the morning, Nan. It
must be very cold,” said Aunt Sallie.</p>

<p>“No, no! I said that noise was a tree
branch banging against the side of the house,”
repeated Nan in louder tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, a tree branch,” murmured the old
lady. “I thought it was some one knocking
at the door. Is my coffee ready, dearie?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have it for you right away,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>So Nan made Aunt Sallie a hot drink while
Bert went down in the cellar to get a sharp
hatchet with which to cut loose the dangling
tree branch. Nan managed to keep Flossie
and Freddie quiet by letting them set the
table for breakfast.</p>

<p>When she took up Aunt Sallie’s coffee and
toast, Bert followed up the stairs, having
put on his rubber boots, mittens, and a warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
jacket. For he would have to climb out on
the snowy roof to cut the tree limb.</p>

<p>As soon as he opened the door out rushed
more cold wind and snow. But he quickly
closed it again, and Nan waited until he was
inside before she opened Aunt Sallie’s door,
which she had gone up to close just before
Bert was ready to begin.</p>

<p>On the carpet beneath the broken window
was a pile of glass and snow. Nearly all the
glass was broken out of the window, only a
few jagged pieces remaining, and these Bert
knocked out with his hatchet so they would
not cut him as he crawled through.</p>

<p>The dangling branch was half way across
the window, but there was room enough for
Bert to dodge through without getting hit by
the swaying limb. Once out on the sloping
porch roof, covered as it was by a blanket of
snow, the Bobbsey lad looked up to see the
best place to start cutting.</p>

<p>As he had said, the branch was attached to
the part that was not broken off by only a
few shreds of wood. Chopping through these
would cause the branch to fall, and it could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
then be pushed off the roof. But the place
where he must do the cutting was above
Bert’s head.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get something to stand on,” he
decided.</p>

<p>He looked around inside the room and saw
a small box. In it Mrs. Bobbsey had packed
away the lace curtains for the guest room.
And when the curtains had been hung the box
had not been taken out.</p>

<p>“I’ll stand on that,” Bert decided. He
pulled the lace curtains of the window to one
side. The curtains were wet with snow, but
Bert thought he and Nan could take them
down and dry them later in the day.</p>

<p>Bert first put the box out on the porch roof
in the snow. Then he crawled out himself.
As he did so the wind swayed the branch and
it nearly hit him, but he managed to scramble
out of the way.</p>

<p>Then, standing on the box, he began to
chop at the shreds of the swaying branch. It
was hard work, but the boy kept at it. The
sharp hatchet shaved through the thin wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“One more shot, and down you’ll come!”
exclaimed Bert.</p>

<p>He aimed a hard blow at what was left of
the shreds. The hatchet cut through them
and the branch fell to the porch roof. No
longer would it bang against the house.</p>

<p>But in making his last stroke, Bert reached
over too far. He felt himself slipping. The
box on which he stood slipped on the snow of
the roof.</p>

<p>The next moment Bert toppled over, fell
on his side, and went rolling toward the edge
of the slanting roof.</p>

<p>“Here I go!” he cried, trying to hold himself
back.</p>

<p>But there was nothing which he could
grasp, and an instant later he slid over the
edge of the roof.</p>

<h3>AUNT SALLIE IS WORSE</h3>


<p>While Nan Bobbsey was putting breakfast
on the table for Flossie and Freddie, and
also for herself and Bert, the smaller twins
were amusing themselves by running to and
fro in the house. They ran into the front
room, up to the windows, out of which they
looked at the storm, and then they ran back
into the dining room.</p>

<p>“Don’t make so much noise!” begged Nan,
while she wondered how Bert was getting
along with cutting off the tree branch.</p>

<p>“We’re playing horse,” explained Freddie.
“Horses have to make noise.”</p>

<p>“He’s the horse and I’m the driver,” said
Flossie.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried her twin brother. “We
have to go to a fire now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Into the front room the smaller twins raced
again, and as they reached the windows they
saw Bert fall off the roof. They knew it was
their brother.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” screamed Flossie. “Look at
Bert!”</p>

<p>Freddie gazed for a moment. Then he
rushed back to the dining room where Nan
was putting the oatmeal on the table and
cried:</p>

<p>“Bert jumped off the roof! Bert jumped
off the roof into a snowdrift in the front yard!
Oh, Nan, you ought to see him!”</p>

<p>Nan gazed wide-eyed at her small brother.
Why should Bert jump off the roof, especially
when he had a sharp hatchet? Perhaps something
worse than this had happened.</p>

<p>Nan hurried into the front room, followed
by Freddie. Flossie was still at the window
looking out.</p>

<p>“Bert’s stuck in a snowdrift,” she reported.
“Look, he can hardly get out!”</p>

<p>And this was true. So deep was the snow
in front of the house, and so far down in the
drift had Bert plunged when he toppled off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
the roof, that it was all the boy could do to
scramble out. Still he was making headway,
floundering about to reach the front steps.</p>

<p>Nan ran to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>“Bert Bobbsey!” she cried. “What did you
want to jump off the roof for?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t jump,” Bert said, somewhat out
of breath as at last he managed to free his
legs and reach the porch.</p>

<p>“Freddie says you jumped,” went on Nan.</p>

<p>“No I didn’t! I fell,” panted Bert. “I
cut the tree branch—and—then I slipped—off
the box. I was standing on a box. I
rolled—off—the roof—but I’m not hurt because
I—fell in a snow bank.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad of that!” exclaimed Nan.</p>

<p>“You are?” cried Bert, with a laugh.
“Well, you wouldn’t be glad if you had as
much snow down your back as I’ve got down
mine!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean that!” Nan exclaimed.
“I mean I’m glad you didn’t get hurt.”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” said Bert. “Falling in the snowdrift,
even off the porch roof, was like landing
in a feather bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“The hatchet might have cut you,” went
on his sister.</p>

<p>“I dropped that up on the roof when I fell,
I guess,” stated Bert. “Well, anyhow, I cut
the branch loose, and it won’t bang any more.
Now we’ve got to nail a blanket over the window
so the wind and snow won’t blow in.”</p>

<p>“You better have your breakfast first,”
Nan suggested.</p>

<p>“No, I’m all snow now and I might as well
finish,” decided Bert. “But I guess you’ll
have to help me put the blanket on, Nan.
I can’t hold both sides up at once.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that,” his sister agreed.</p>

<p>“We’ll help, too!” cried Freddie, speaking
for himself and his twin sister.</p>

<p>“No, you two get your breakfast,” decided
Nan. “It’s all on the table ready for you.
And be good children, now.”</p>

<p>“We will,” promised Flossie. “I’ll let
Freddie eat out of my oatmeal dish if he
wants to.”</p>

<p>“Each of you has a dish,” laughed Nan.
“There’s no need of sharing them. Now come
on, Bert, and we’ll fix that window.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>Nan knew where her mother kept the extra
bed clothes, and from the closet she took a
heavy woolen blanket. Bert got some big
tacks from his father’s tool box down in the
cellar, and then the two older Bobbsey twins
began work to keep out the wintry blast
which seemed to howl with glee as it rushed
through the broken window.</p>

<p>Bert found where he had dropped the
hatchet in the snow on the roof before he
rolled off.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring that in to hammer with, and we
can stand on the box,” he told Nan.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a lot of snow on the carpet!
And broken glass, too!” exclaimed the girl.
“Mother would feel badly if she saw this.”</p>

<p>“I’ll clean it up as soon as we get the blanket
tacked on,” said Bert.</p>

<p>It was not easy for him and Nan to put up
the heavy blanket and tack it fast to the
sides of the window. For the wind would
blow hard every now and then, spreading the
blanket out like a sail of a boat. But at last
they managed to get it in place, and then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
wind could no longer enter, nor did any more
snow sift in.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get a glass man to fix the
window,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Can’t get anybody until after this storm
is over,” was Bert’s opinion. “A glass man
might fall off the roof and break the new
pane he brought. I guess this will be all
right for a while. Nobody sleeps in here,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Nan, “it will be all right.
It doesn’t matter if this room is cold.”</p>

<p>Bert got broom and dustpan and cleaned
up the snow before it should melt on the carpet.
He also picked up the broken pieces of
glass, taking care not to cut his fingers, and
put them in an ash can in the cellar.</p>

<p>“And now I guess it’s time I had my breakfast,”
he decided, when everything had been
made as nearly right as possible.</p>

<p>“I’ll eat with you,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you had your breakfast, either?”
asked Bert, in surprise.</p>

<p>“I haven’t had time,” explained Nan. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
had to look after Aunt Sallie and the twins.”</p>

<p>She and Bert were on their way to the dining
room, when suddenly they heard the
voices of Flossie and Freddie.</p>

<p>“Stop! Now you stop, Freddie Bobbsey!
Quit, I’ll tell Dinah on you!” Flossie wailed.</p>

<p>“Dinah isn’t here!” retorted Freddie.</p>

<p>“Guess those two need more looking after,”
laughed Bert to Nan.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re always up to something!” she
sighed, as she hurried into the dining room.</p>

<p>Nan and Bert saw Freddie trying to pull
away from Flossie the oatmeal dish the little
girl had been using. Flossie was clinging to
one side of it, and at the same time shouting:</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop! Now you stop, Freddie
Bobbsey!”</p>

<p>“Give me the dish! Let me have it!” insisted
the little boy.</p>

<p>“Stop, Freddie!” called Nan. “Why are
you trying to take away Flossie’s dish?”</p>

<p>“She’s through with it. She’s eaten up all
her oatmeal,” Freddie said. “I’m going to
take the dish out in the kitchen and wash it.”</p>

<p>“No, you mustn’t do that,” said Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“I want to help you wash the dishes!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear, but I don’t need any
help this morning,” Nan said.</p>

<p>“And he sha’n’t have my dish! I haven’t
eaten all my oatmeal!” wailed Flossie.</p>

<p>“Oh, you did so eat it all up! There isn’t
any left!” exclaimed Freddie.</p>

<p>“There is so!” retorted Flossie, trying hard
to pull the dish away from her brother.
“There’s sugar and milk in my dish and I
want it, Freddie Bobbsey.”</p>

<p>Bert had a look in the dish over which there
was such a dispute. There was only a very
little milk on the bottom—hardly a spoonful.
But sometimes Flossie could be very fussy
over little things, and this was one of those
occasions.</p>

<p>“Her dish is empty and it ought to be
washed,” Freddie said, and he would not let
go his hold until Bert took his fingers off, saying:</p>

<p>“Come on, Freddie, I’ll let you help me
make the water wheel as soon as I’ve had
something to eat. Let the girls do the
dishes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” agreed the little boy. Then
to Flossie he cried:</p>

<p>“Girls are cry babies and they have to wash
dishes! Boys make things, and I’m going to
make a water wheel!”</p>

<p>“I am not a cry baby, am I, Nan?” appealed
Flossie.</p>

<p>“No, dear, you aren’t, of course,” Nan answered.
“You mustn’t call names, Freddie.”</p>

<p>“Well, then why didn’t she let me take her
dish out when it was empty?” the little boy
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t empty! I’m going to eat the rest
of my oatmeal,” said Flossie, and she began
to scrape up with her spoon what little milk
remained. There was hardly enough to show,
but Flossie made as much work over it as
though the dish were half full.</p>

<p>“You can help me with the dishes, Flossie,
as soon as Bert and I have our breakfast,”
Nan said, and this pleased the little girl.
And Freddie forgot about his dispute with
Flossie when he thought of helping Bert
with the water wheel.</p>

<p>The storm kept up all that morning, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
it was so severe that though Bert wanted to
go to the post-office to inquire if any mail had
come in, Nan would not let him.</p>

<p>“You might get stuck in a drift and never
get back,” she said.</p>

<p>“Pooh! I guess I could get out of a drift!”
laughed Bert. “Didn’t I get out of the one I
fell into off the roof?”</p>

<p>But Nan was so worried over the storm and
about being left alone that Bert said he would
stay at home.</p>

<p>It was still snowing at noon when Nan served
lunch. Though as she looked in the pantry
she said to herself:</p>

<p>“Somebody will have to go to the store
to-morrow or we’ll not have much to eat. I
don’t believe the stores will deliver anything.
But maybe Bert can get out in the morning
if the snow stops.”</p>

<p>After Nan had seen to it that things were
put on the table for Bert, Flossie and Freddie,
she carried something up to Aunt Sallie,
without waiting to get anything for herself.</p>

<p>As Nan entered the old lady’s room she saw
Mrs. Pry tossing from side to side in the bed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
just as Nan had once seen Flossie toss in a
fever.</p>

<p>“Who—who is that?” murmured Mrs. Pry
in a faint voice, as Nan set the tray of food
down on a table near the bed. “Is that the
doctor?”</p>

<p>“No. This is Nan Bobbsey,” said the little
girl. “Don’t you know me, Aunt Sallie?”
She feared the old lady was out of her head
with fever.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know you, Nan,” was the low
answer. “But I thought you were the doctor.
When is the doctor coming?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know,” and Nan was puzzled.
“Did you want me to send for the
doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearie, I wish you would. I called
down to you to send for him, but I guess you
didn’t hear me.”</p>

<p>“Flossie and Freddie were making so much
noise, I guess I didn’t hear you,” said Nan.
“But I’ll get the doctor right away, if you
think you want him.”</p>

<p>“I’d better have him, Nan. I’m much
worse, I fear. I’m very sick and the lumbago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
is worse. That liniment doesn’t seem to help
me any. Send for the doctor. Dr. Martin
is the best one, and he doesn’t live far from
here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have Bert telephone for him right
away,” promised Nan. “And see, I have
brought you up something to eat.”</p>

<p>“I’m too sick to eat, dearie,” moaned Aunt
Sallie. “Get the doctor as soon as you can.”</p>

<p>Nan hurried downstairs and told Bert. He
went to the telephone, but after waiting some
time he heard no voice of the operator asking
what number he wanted.</p>

<p>“I guess the telephone wires are broken,
Nan,” he said. “I’ll have to go over to Dr.
Martin’s house to tell him to come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed Nan, and she looked out
of the window at the storm which was still
raging fiercely.</p>

</div>

<h3>IN CHURCH AGAIN</h3>


<p>There was no help for it. If the doctor
was to come to Aunt Sallie to help her, Bert
must go after him. The telephone would not
work.</p>

<p>“It isn’t far,” Bert said to Nan when he had
tried several more times to get an answer
from the telephone operator. “I can soon
push my way down to Dr. Martin’s office.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he won’t come back with you,”
suggested Nan. “Maybe he’ll think the
storm is too bad for him to come out in.”</p>

<p>“Doctors aren’t that way,” declared Bert.
“They go out in any kind of a storm when
anybody is sick.”</p>

<p>So he made ready to go out, again putting
on his boots and getting out his long overcoat
and mittens.</p>

<p>In order to leave his legs free, when he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
chopping at the tree branch Bert had put on
a short “pea jacket,” as sailors call them.
But now to venture out on the streets in the
storm, he decided his longer overcoat would
be best.</p>

<p>Inside the warm, cosy house the storm had
not seemed quite as terrible as it was to Bert
when he stepped outside. At first the wind
nearly took away his breath, and the snowflakes,
tossed this way and that way by the
wintry blast, stung the boy’s cheeks.</p>

<p>But he laughed and shouted, pretending
that he was a soldier fighting the storm, and
he floundered out into the drifts and down
toward Dr. Martin’s house. There were very
few persons out in the tempest, which was, in
fact, a blizzard. Bert saw no one whom he
knew, but a man who was tramping his way
through the snow called to the boy:</p>

<p>“Quite a storm!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” panted Bert, stopping to get
his breath.</p>

<p>“More wires down than before,” the man
went on. “And a lot of trains are stuck in
the snow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>Bert felt a sinking feeling in his heart, and
he hoped his father and mother had not
started back from Uncle Rossiter’s only to be
snowed-in. Bert decided he would say nothing
to Nan about what this man had told
him.</p>

<p>Floundering on through the snow, falling
down once, but getting up quickly again with
a laugh, Bert at last reached the doctor’s
house and rang the bell. A maid let him in
the office.</p>

<p>“The doctor will see you in a few minutes,”
she said.</p>

<p>“I don’t want him to see me,” replied Bert.
“I’m not sick. It’s Aunt Sallie Pry. She’s
staying at our house and she has the lumbago.”</p>

<p>The maid smiled at the boy, and the doctor,
who happened to be in the next room,
opened the door, for Bert had spoken rather
loudly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert, it’s you, is it?” asked Dr. Martin,
for he knew the Bobbsey twins. “What’s
the trouble at your house?”</p>

<p>Bert told him, mentioning that his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
and mother, as well as Sam and Dinah, were
away.</p>

<p>“And you twins are keeping house all alone,
are you?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“Sure we are,” said Bert, a bit proudly.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a fine family of children, I’ll
say that for you!” said Dr. Martin admiringly.
“I’ll come over and see what I can
do for Aunt Sallie in a little while.”</p>

<p>“Bring something for the lumbago,” advised
Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do that,” the doctor promised,
laughing. “And don’t get stuck in a snowdrift
going back, Bert.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” said the boy. “But I was stuck
in one early this morning,” and he told about
having fallen off the roof.</p>

<p>Out again into the storm stepped Bert
Bobbsey. Back over the way he had come
he floundered again. When a little way
from home he heard a faint mewing sound.</p>

<p>“It’s a cat!” cried Bert. “I wonder if that
could be our cat Snoop come back?” For
Snoop, with Snap, the dog, had been sent
away to an animal doctor’s for a time. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
mewing of the cat sounded more plainly, and
Bert looked around.</p>

<p>Then, up in a tree, but not far above the
ground, he saw a little maltese kitten.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor little cat!” exclaimed Bert.
“I guess you’re lost in the storm. I’ll take
you home.”</p>

<p>He reached up, and, by standing on his
tiptoes, managed to get hold of the pussy.
She dug her claws into the bark of the tree,
for she was afraid of falling. But Bert gently
pulled her loose, and then cuddled her in his
arms, murmuring:</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re a nice little kitten! I’m glad
I found you! Flossie and Freddie will just
love you and Nan will give you some warm
milk. I guess you got out of some house and
don’t know how to get back.”</p>

<p>However, there were no houses very near
the tree in which Bert had found the little
cat. So, not knowing to whom she belonged
he took her home with him. At first the
pussy mewed pitifully as Bert cuddled her in
his arms. But soon she began to purr contentedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Now you’re happy,” said the boy.</p>

<p>Nan opened the side door for Bert, for she
was watching for him to come back, and at
first she did not see the cat.</p>

<p>“Is the doctor coming?” Nan wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“He’ll be here in a little while,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>Then the pussy in Bert’s arms moved and
Nan caught sight of the bright eyes and the
little tail waving.</p>

<p>“Oh, the darling!” she cried. “Where did
you get her, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Found her mewing up in a tree.”</p>

<p>By this time Flossie and Freddie, having
heard Bert enter, ran to greet him, and they,
too, saw the pussy.</p>

<p>“Oh, can I have her?” Flossie wanted to
know, reaching up to stroke the animal in
Bert’s arms.</p>

<p>“Is that Snoop growed little?” Freddie
asked, for Snoop was a very big cat.</p>

<p>“This is Snowflake—a new cat,” Bert answered.
“I named her Snowflake because I
got her out in the snowstorm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I just love her!” cried Flossie.
“Please let me hold Snowflake!”</p>

<p>“I want to hold her, too,” broke in Freddie.</p>

<p>“Now look here!” said Bert, somewhat
sternly. “There must be no pulling this
pussy apart by you two to see who’s going to
hold her. You must take turns. As soon as
I hear you disputing over the pussy I’ll put
her back in the tree where I found her.”</p>

<p>This was such a terrible thing to think of
having happen that Flossie and Freddie were
quite alarmed.</p>

<p>“I won’t pull the pussy,” promised Freddie.</p>

<p>“And I won’t, either,” said Flossie. “Freddie,
you can take her now for a little while, if
you like. And I’ll take a turn afterward.”</p>

<p>“All right, Flossie, thank you,” said Freddie
politely.</p>

<p>Very gently he took the pussy in his arms,
and Nan and Bert looked at each other, smiling
over the heads of the smaller Bobbsey
children.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing you said that to them,
or else they’d be disputing all the while,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
whispered Nan. “Now they’ll be quiet for
a time.”</p>

<p>Dr. Martin came in a little while and went
up to see Mrs. Pry.</p>

<p>“Where does it hurt you the most?” he
asked the old lady.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Aunt Sallie, sitting
up in bed. “You say you fell over a post?
I hope you didn’t get hurt, Dr. Martin.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t fall over a post,” said the
doctor, and then he looked up to see Nan behind
Mrs. Pry’s back motioning to her ears,
to let him know the old lady was deaf. “I
asked you where the pain hurt <em>most</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the pain—yes. You don’t speak as
loudly as you used to, Dr. Martin, or else my
hearing is getting bad. Why, the pain mostly
is in my back.”</p>

<p>The doctor then asked her other questions
and left some medicine for her, saying he
thought she would be better in a few days.</p>

<p>“Keep her warm,” he told Nan, as he was
leaving, having promised to come the next
day. “Heat is the best thing for lumbago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been giving her hot flatirons for her
back,” Nan explained.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea—keep it up,” said Dr.
Martin. “And how are you getting on with
your housekeeping, alone as you are?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty well,” Nan said. “Of course
we’re lonesome without father and mother.
And when the window got smashed early this
morning we were all frightened. But Bert
fixed it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he nearly fixed himself at the
same time,” laughed the doctor as he remembered
what Bert had told him about falling
off the porch roof. “Well, good-bye and
good luck,” he said, as he went out into the
storm. “And keep Aunt Sallie warm.”</p>

<p>Nan felt better, now that the doctor had
called, and she was glad Flossie and Freddie
had the kitten to play with. But soon Freddie
came to Nan in the kitchen and said:</p>

<p>“Snowflake is hungry. She wants some
milk, I guess.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any milk, except sweetened
condensed, and I don’t believe she’ll like
that,” Nan said. “I wish we had some fresh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
milk and some other things from the store.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” offered Bert. “It isn’t snowing
quite so hard now.”</p>

<p>This was true. The flakes were not falling
quite so fast and the wind had gone down
a little. So Nan thought it would be all
right for Bert to venture out. Freddie, of
course, wanted to go, but it was not hard to
persuade him to stay in to help Flossie look
after Snowflake.</p>

<p>Nan told Bert what to buy at the store and
gave him a basket in which to carry the
groceries.</p>

<p>“I’ll stop at the post-office and see if there’s
any mail in yet,” decided the Bobbsey boy as
once more he went out into the snow.</p>

<p>He went to the post-office first, and was
much disappointed when he learned that
there were no letters for him or Nan.</p>

<p>“The trains snowed up yet?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Most of them must be,” said the postmaster.
“Anyhow, no mail has come in.
Maybe there’ll be some to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Bert certainly hoped so, and he could not
help worrying about his father and mother.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
They might be in a train that was buried
deep in a great heap of snow, and there might
be nothing to eat in the cars.</p>

<p>“I wish they’d come home,” sighed Bert.</p>

<p>He found several men and boys in the store,
buying things to eat, for it had not been possible
to make any deliveries. Charlie Mason
was there, getting things for his folks.</p>

<p>“Say, it’s fun, not to have to go to school,
isn’t it?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes, some fun,” Bert admitted. “But I
guess it will open in a few days now. This
storm can’t last much longer.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” answered Charlie. “Seen
anything of Danny Rugg?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him the other day,” Bert answered.
“But I don’t like him any more.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” agreed Charlie. “Danny is getting
bad again—like he used to be.”</p>

<p>The two boys parted outside the store,
Charlie going one way with his basket of
food, and Bert the other. And it was when
Bert came in front of the church—the same
church where the window had been broken—that
Bert once more saw Danny Rugg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>This time the young bully did not see Bert,
for Danny was intent on slipping in the side
door of the church, which was open. Danny
also had a basket of food.</p>

<p>“Say, this is queer!” murmured Bert to
himself. “What’s he going into the church
again for? I’m going to find out. Maybe
he’s going to try to mend that broken window,”
and Bert looked up at the stained glass.
It had not yet been repaired, a plain piece of
white glass having been put over the hole.</p>

<p>Waiting a moment, until Danny was inside
the church, Bert softly followed. He set his
basket of groceries down in the vestibule,
stood still and listened.</p>

<p>He heard Danny tramping up to the balcony.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll catch him at whatever he’s up
to,” whispered Bert to himself. “And I’m
not going to fall down any trapdoors, either!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty">XX</abbr></h2>
</div>

<h3>DANNY’S RING</h3>


<p>Bert knew that he must be very careful
and cautious this time. Not only must he
watch out for the open trapdoor, but he must
take care that Danny neither saw nor heard
him.</p>

<p>“For if he hears me,” said Bert to himself,
“he’ll run out and then I can’t find why he
came in here. Danny’s smart, but I’ve got
to be smarter.”</p>

<p>Moving slowly across the vestibule floor
and looking back to see that his basket of
groceries was safe, Bert soon reached a place
where he knew the trapdoor to be.</p>

<p>“It’s closed,” he told himself. “That’s
good! No danger now of falling down. And
I hope nobody else comes in here. They
might take the things in my basket, and Nan
and the others would go hungry. But I guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
I’d have to go back to the store and get
more,” silently chuckled Bert.</p>

<p>Having made sure that the trapdoor, down
which he had fallen on his previous visit to
the church, was closed, Bert stood near it for
a while and listened. He could hear Danny
moving about “upstairs,” as you might call
it, though really it was in the gallery of the
church.</p>

<p>This gallery held the big pipe organ, which
made such thunderous music on Sundays, and
in this gallery the choir singers also had their
places.</p>

<p>The remainder of the balcony was given
over to pews for the congregation to sit in,
when the pews on the main floor of the church
were filled. The boys always liked to sit up
in the balcony, for they seemed off by themselves
when they did this. But the ushers
and some of the deacons did not like the boys
to go to the gallery, for fear the lads would
“cut up.” And sometimes this very thing
happened. And you may easily guess that
Danny Rugg was among the “cut-ups.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s the reason he’s going up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
there now,” thought Bert to himself. “Maybe
he’s getting ready to play some trick in
church next Sunday—he and Sam Todd. He
couldn’t be coming up to mend the broken
window. He wouldn’t know how to put in
all the different pieces of colored glass, and,
anyhow, he didn’t have any glass with him
when he came in here.”</p>

<p>Bert’s thought that Danny might be preparing
for some trick to be played in church
the following Sunday came about because
once before, about a year ago, Danny and
Sam had hidden a little dog up in the gallery
one Saturday night. And the following Sunday,
when the minister was preaching, the
dog crawled out from beneath a pew, walked
downstairs and up the middle aisle of the
church, much to the amusement of Danny
and his cronies.</p>

<p>But the deacons and the minister did not
like this, for it disturbed the congregation,
and of course it was a wrong thing for Danny
to have done.</p>

<p>Because of that trick, the boys had been
forbidden to go up in the gallery unless their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
parents were with them. All this Bert
thought of as he stood in the silent church,
trying to find out what it was that Danny
had come in about.</p>

<p>“I’ll follow after him as easy as I can,”
said Bert to himself. “Maybe I can watch
him. But I mustn’t let him see me.”</p>

<p>Bert wore his rubber boots. So, for that
matter, did Danny Rugg, for the snow was
so deep that boots were needed. But Bert
walked more softly in his boots than did
Danny, who tramped around in the balcony
as if he did not care who heard him. Bert
went on his tiptoes, and the rubber soles of
his boots made very little noise.</p>

<p>Up the balcony stairs the Bobbsey boy followed
the other lad. It was very still and
quiet in the church, and the footsteps of
Danny echoed with a strange, hollow sound.
On account of the snow covering the ground
outside there was no noise of rattling wagons
or trucks, so the church was even more quiet
than usual.</p>

<p>How different it was from Sundays, when
the people were coming in or going out, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
the place was lighted, and when there was
organ music and singing.</p>

<p>“I don’t like church on week days,”
thought Bert.</p>

<p>But he had come in for a special purpose,
and he was going to carry it out. Step after
step he went up to the gallery floor, making
no noise. He could still hear Danny moving
about.</p>

<p>At last Bert reached a place where, in the
dim light that came through the stained-glass
window, he could see Danny walking along
between the rows of pews.</p>

<p>“He’s right near the broken window,”
whispered Bert to himself. “And he’s looking
on the floor for something. I wonder
what it is? He can’t be looking for the
broken bits of stained glass, to put them back—they
were picked up long ago. I wonder
what it is he’s looking for?”</p>

<p>Danny was certainly looking for something.
He bent over and let his eyes rove about
the floor, right under the window that had
been broken. Closely and carefully Danny
searched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>Then, almost as if some one had shouted it
at him, there came into Bert’s mind the
thought:</p>

<p>“Danny’s looking for his lost birthday
ring! It must have slipped off his finger in
one of the snowballs he threw that day of the
first storm. The gold ring stuck in the snowball,
and Danny threw the snowball at the
window! The ball broke the glass and came
inside the balcony here. And Danny must
know that! He hasn’t found his ring anywhere
else, and he knows it must have been
in that snowball!”</p>

<p>The idea excited Bert and made his heart
beat faster.</p>

<p>“When the snowball melted,” thought Bert,
still watching Danny eagerly, “the ring would
drop out on the floor and stay there. It’s his
ring that Danny’s searching for!”</p>

<p>Bert grew so excited at this thought that he
made a sudden movement. His foot slipped
and banged against a pew.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Danny, jumping up.
“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>Bert was quick enough to dodge down behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
one of the pews, so that when Danny
looked up he saw no one.</p>

<p>But though Danny saw no one, he was
frightened because of the noise, and, not stopping
any longer to search for his lost ring, or
whatever it was he was looking for, he darted
out of the balcony and down the stairs, with
many a clatter of his rubber boots.</p>

<p>“Say, he’s running like a scared rabbit!”
chuckled Bert to himself. “I wish I dared
yell at him, so he’d know who it is that’s looking
at him. But I guess I’d better not. I
want to see if his ring is here.”</p>

<p>Pausing not to look back, Danny ran down
to the main floor and out of the side door.</p>

<p>“I hope he doesn’t take my basket of
groceries,” thought Bert. But he remembered
he had set it over in a dark corner,
where it would not be likely to be seen.
And, as a matter of fact, Danny Rugg was so
frightened that he thought of nothing but
taking his own basket of food and hurrying
out of the church.</p>

<p>Bert heard the door slam after the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
boy, and then the Bobbsey lad began to wonder
what was the best thing to do.</p>

<p>“If Danny’s ring is there and I find it, I can
prove that he threw the snowball that broke
the window,” said Bert to himself. “But
even if I pick up the ring on the balcony floor,
Danny might say I found it somewhere else
and put it there. I ought to have some one
with me when I find it—if I do—and whoever’s
with me can say I didn’t put it there.
I’ve got to get some one to help me.”</p>

<p>Bert remembered that Mr. Henry Ander,
one of the church deacons, a good and kindly
man who was well acquainted with the Bobbsey
family, lived close to the church.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and get Mr. Ander before I look
for the ring,” decided Bert.</p>

<p>He started down the balcony stairs, though
he was more than anxious to look for the lost
ring, for the finding of that would clear Bert’s
name from the suspicion of having broken
the window. But knowing that the plan he
had made was best, Bert kept on.</p>

<p>As he was crossing the dim vestibule on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
way to the side door, Bert heard some one
coming in.</p>

<p>“I hope that isn’t Danny coming back!”
Bert whispered.</p>

<p>It was not. It was Mr. Shull.</p>

<p>“Well, Bert, what in the world are you doing
here?” asked the sexton, in surprise.
“Are you trying to fall down the trapdoor
again?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t, very well, anyhow,” went
on the janitor. “For the door is closed.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come in here for that,” said Bert.
“Listen, Mr. Shull. Do you remember when
the church window was broken?”</p>

<p>“I should say I do remember it, Bert!
They said you did it, but I have my doubts
of that.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it,” said Bert. “But I know
who did. It was Danny Rugg, and I can
prove it if I can find his gold ring on the floor.
It was in the snowball he threw, and Danny
was in here just now, trying to find his ring.”</p>

<p>Bert told all that had happened.</p>

<p>“I want to get Mr. Ander,” went on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
Bobbsey boy. “If he and you see me find the
ring, you’ll know I didn’t throw that snowball.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good idea, Bert!” exclaimed the sexton.
“Go get the deacon, and we’ll look for
the ring together—all three of us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ander was surprised a few minutes
later when Bert, much excited, poured out the
story of the snowball, the broken window,
and the lost ring.</p>

<p>“All right, Bert,” he said at length. “I’ll
go with you and look for the ring. And if
we find it, I’ll take it and give it to Mr. Rugg
with Danny there looking on. And I’ll take
you with me. We’ll clear you of the charge
of having broken the window.”</p>

<p>A little later the eager, excited boy and the
two men, almost as eager as Bert himself,
were looking over the floor beneath the
broken window. The sexton got his electric
flashlight and the sharp beams of this glinted
over the floor.</p>

<p>“Look! I see something glittering like
gold!” cried Bert, pointing to a crack under
a pew. “See if that’s the ring!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>The sexton focused his light on the object.
Mr. Ander took out his knife, and with the
blade of it pried the shining object out of the
crack.</p>

<p>“It’s a gold ring, all right,” he said, holding
it up to the light.</p>

<p>“See if it has any initials on it,” suggested
Bert.</p>

<p>“Hold the light closer, Mr. Shull,” said the
deacon. When this had been done he slowly
said: “It’s got the letters D. R. on it—this
ring has.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s Danny Rugg’s ring!” cried Bert.
“It was in the snowball that broke the window.
That’s what he was up here looking
for! Oh, I’m so glad we’ve found it!”</p>

<h3>FIRE</h3>


<p>The deacon, Mr. Ander, and the sexton
looked carefully around on the floor of the
balcony near the broken window. They even
found some little slivers of colored glass, for
only the larger pieces had been swept up.</p>

<p>“Danny’s ring certainly came in here, stuck
to the snowball he threw against the window,”
decided the deacon. “It’s as plain as
if we saw it happen. And I think, Bert,
when I hand this ring to Danny’s father and
tell how it was found—I think Danny will
confess just how it happened. I want you
with me when he does, so your name will be
cleared.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like to go with you,” Bert said.
“But I ought to go home now. I’ve been
away a good while, and maybe Nan might
want some of the groceries I have in the basket
downstairs. Nan is home alone with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
Flossie and Freddie. Mrs. Pry is sick in
bed.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better go home now,” agreed
the deacon when Bert had further explained
how it was the Bobbsey twins were keeping
house by themselves. “This evening after
supper I’ll call for you and we’ll take this ring
back to Danny.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to come along?” asked
the sexton. “I’m going to be pretty busy,
keeping up the fires, for it’s going to be a cold
night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” agreed Mr. Ander “No, I
don’t believe we need you, Robert. Two witnesses
are enough to prove where the lost ring
was found.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Bert. “I’ll be ready for
you after supper.”</p>

<p>It was with a very much lighter heart than
he had had on entering the church that Bert
left the edifice. Picking up his basket of
groceries he started for home.</p>

<p>“Say, it is mighty cold!” he murmured as
he felt the tingling air nip his ears and nose.
“I’ll have to keep up a good fire in our furnace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
Mrs. Pry has got to be kept warm
with her lumbago.”</p>

<p>On leaving the church, Bert looked around
for a sight of Danny Rugg, but that small
bully and cheat was not in view, and Bert
was glad of it.</p>

<p>“For if he saw me coming out of the
church,” reasoned Bert, “he would guess that
I made the noise that scared him away. Now
he’ll be surprised when we hand him his
ring.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ander put the gold finger ornament in
his pocket and went back home, planning to
go to Bert’s house in the evening. Danny
lived not far from the Bobbsey house.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it can be proved that Bert didn’t
break the window,” said the sexton.</p>

<p>“So am I,” agreed the deacon. “Bert’s a
good boy. I never liked to think that he
broke the window. Yet the other boys said
he did.”</p>

<p>“Well, Danny never actually said so,” remarked
Mr. Shull. “But he kept quiet about
it when he knew that he, himself, had thrown
the snowball that did the damage. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
just as bad as if Danny had said Bert did it.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” agreed the deacon.</p>

<p>Bert found Nan and the small twins waiting
rather anxiously for him when he got
back.</p>

<p>“Did you get a letter from mother?” asked
Nan as soon as the door was opened.</p>

<p>“No, not yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I wonder what’s the matter,”
and tears were in Nan’s eyes.</p>

<p>“They’re all right,” declared Bert. “It’s
just that the mails are late on account of the
storm. I guess we’ll hear from them by to-morrow.
But, Nan, I’ve got good news!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked. “Did you see
Sam and Dinah coming back?”</p>

<p>“No. But maybe they’ll be along soon.
But I found Danny’s ring in the church under
the broken window, and that proves he did
it,” and the boy quickly told his sister what
had happened.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad of that!” cried Nan.
“Danny was mean to keep still and let it be
thought you did it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s a sort of a sneak,” agreed Bert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
“But wait until he sees the deacon and me
with his ring! He’ll feel queer then!”</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie were playing about the
house when Bert came back, and they were
delighted when he gave them some sticks of
candy he had bought at the store.</p>

<p>“Aunt Sallie says she feels cold,” reported
Nan, when she had taken a cup of tea and one
of the lamb chops Bert had brought up to
the invalid. “Can you make the house any
warmer, Bert? You know Doctor Martin
said we must keep her lumbago warm.”</p>

<p>“I’ll turn on the furnace more, shake it
down and put a lot of coal on,” decided the
boy. “I’m glad we have plenty of coal in the
bin.”</p>

<p>“So am I!” agreed Nan.</p>

<p>Soon the pipes were cracking with the additional
heat that Bert turned on. And
though the wind still blew cold outside and
though more flakes of snow began to fall as
evening settled down, the Bobbsey twins were
warm and snug.</p>

<p>Of course they were lonesome without their
parents, and they surely wished Dinah and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
Sam would return. But Bert and Nan, putting
aside their own feelings, amused Flossie
and Freddie, so that the small twins laughed
merrily.</p>

<p>“Will you be afraid to stay here while I
go out with Mr. Ander a little while?” asked
Bert of his sister, when supper was over.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Nan answered. “That is, if
you don’t stay too late.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” he promised. “Only long
enough to give Danny back his ring and see
what he has to say.”</p>

<p>A little later the deacon arrived at the
Bobbsey house. He went to the side door
and brushed the snow off his boots with a
broom that was kept there for the purpose.</p>

<p>“Is it snowing much?” asked Bert, as he
let Mr. Ander in.</p>

<p>“Yes, snowing hard,” was the answer. “I
don’t know when we’ve had so much snow
this early in the winter. It keeps up as if it
would never stop. How are you, Nan?” he
asked kindly. “And how is the fat fairy and
the big fireman?” he asked, patting Flossie
and Freddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>Fairy and fireman were the pet names Mr.
Bobbsey often called his small twins, and the
deacon, being a friend of the family, remembered
this.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” Freddie answered. “Do
you think there’ll be a fire to-night, Mr. Deacon?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ander—not Mr. Deacon!” corrected
Nan.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all the same,” laughed the kindly
man. “Names don’t mean anything. But I
surely hope there won’t be any fires, little
man. The engines would have hard work
getting through the drifts.”</p>

<p>“We got a little kittie out of a snowdrift,”
said Flossie. “Bert found her and she’s
named Snowflake. Here she is,” and she
picked up the little cat and put her in the
deacon’s lap.</p>

<p>“Say, she’s real cute!” laughed Mr. Ander,
who was fond of animals. He gently rubbed
the pussy’s ears and scratched her under her
chin, which she seemed to like very much.</p>

<p>By this time Bert was dressed to go out
and he and the deacon started through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
storm to the Rugg home, not far away. Mr.
Rugg, who opened the door, seemed surprised
to meet Bert and Mr. Ander.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” greeted the deacon. “Is
Danny in?”</p>

<p>“Danny? Yes, I guess so,” answered Mr.
Rugg slowly. “Did you want to see him?
Has he been doing anything?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing new. And it isn’t such a terrible
thing, after all, I suppose,” replied the
deacon. “The worst part of it was keeping
quiet and letting some one else be blamed.
Oh, there you are, Danny,” he went on, as the
boy himself came into the room.</p>

<p>No sooner did Danny catch sight of Bert
and the deacon than he seemed to know what
was “in the wind,” as the saying is.</p>

<p>Mr. Ander lost no time.</p>

<p>“Is this your ring, Danny?” asked the deacon,
holding out on the palm of his hand the
gold circlet.</p>

<p>Before Danny could answer Mr. Rugg
stepped forward and took the ring from the
deacon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“Why, yes, that’s Danny’s ring!” exclaimed
the boy’s father. “I bought it for his birthday.
He told me he lost it at school. I
guess he did, for only yesterday I met the
principal and he said the ring hadn’t been
found.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s found now,” said Mr. Ander,
with a little smile at Bert. “And though
Danny didn’t exactly lose it at school, it was
near there. That’s your ring, isn’t it,
Danny?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, sir,” faltered the boy. “It’s
my birthday ring.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to know where we found
it—where Bert and I found it?” went on the
deacon.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, sir, I—I guess I do.” Danny’s
voice was low.</p>

<p>“Maybe you can guess where we found it,”
went on the deacon, while Mr. Rugg looked
curiously at his son and then at the visitors.
“I think you can guess, Danny, but I’m going
to tell you.</p>

<p>“Bert and I and Mr. Shull, the sexton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
found your ring in the church balcony, right
under the broken stained-glass window. The
window was broken by a snowball thrown
through it, Danny. The ring must have
been in the snowball, and when the snow
melted the ring fell out on the floor and into
a crack. It has been there ever since. Danny
Rugg, were you in the church this afternoon
looking for this lost ring?”</p>

<p>The deacon’s voice was now stern.</p>

<p>Danny hung his head.</p>

<p>“Answer, Danny,” ordered his father. “Is
this true?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, sir,” mumbled Danny. “I
went there to look for my ring. I—I thought
it might have been in the snowball.”</p>

<p>“Did you throw the snowball that broke
the church window?” asked Mr. Rugg in
stern tones.</p>

<p>Danny hung his head and was silent.</p>

<p>“Better own up and tell the truth,” said
the deacon more gently.</p>

<p>“Oh, I did it! Yes, I did it!” and Danny
burst out crying. “I didn’t mean to, but I
broke the window. I was trying to throw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
over the church, but my hand slipped and the
ball went through the window.</p>

<p>“Then, right after that, I missed my ring.
First I thought it had dropped off. But
when it wasn’t found I thought maybe it had
stuck to the snowball and gone inside the
church. So I went in to look.</p>

<p>“I went in once before, but I heard a noise
and I ran out. That was when Bert fell
down the trapdoor.”</p>

<p>“Is that so, Bert?” asked the deacon.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the answer. “I didn’t want
to say why I went in the church, though, until
I could be sure what Danny wanted in there.”</p>

<p>“And you went into the church the second
time, to-day, Danny, did you?” asked the
deacon.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I went to see if I could find my
ring. And if I found it I was going to tell
that I broke the window—and that it wasn’t
Bert.”</p>

<p>“Better late than never,” the deacon said.
“Well, I guess Bert is cleared now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll tell everything,” sobbed Danny.
“I wouldn’t have let it be thought Bert did it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
only Sam said he saw Bert throw the same
time I did, and I thought, maybe, after all,
Bert’s ball broke the glass.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t!” exclaimed Bert. “For I only
threw my snowball on the ground.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rugg placed the ring on the table.
Danny was still sobbing brokenly in one corner
of the room.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry this has happened,” said
Mr. Rugg. “I will punish Danny for his
part in it, and I will pay for the broken window,
Mr. Ander. I will also make Danny
get up in front of the whole school and confess
so Bert’s name will be cleared.”</p>

<p>“If you do that and the window is paid for,
I think Danny will have been punished
enough,” suggested the deacon. “I don’t believe
he will ever do a thing like this again.
Will you, Danny?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, never! Never! Not as long as I
live!” sobbed the boy, and Bert felt sorry for
him.</p>

<p>“Well, this is what we came for, and I’m
glad it’s over with,” announced Mr. Ander.
“I’ll trust you to pay for the stained-glass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
window, Mr. Rugg, and also see to it that
Danny tells the truth as soon as school opens
again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of it,” promised Danny’s
father.</p>

<p>Bert waited a moment and then walked
over to where his former chum was standing,
sobbing.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Danny,” said Bert in a low
voice. “I don’t mind, now that it’s known I
didn’t do it. I’ll be friends with you again.”</p>

<p>“Tha-thanks,” faltered Danny, and then
the hands of the two boys met in a firm clasp.</p>

<p>“They’ll be better friends than ever,” whispered
the deacon to Mr. Rugg.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said the father. “Danny
needs a lesson. I hope he will profit by this
one.”</p>

<p>Nan rejoiced with Bert when he got home
and told all that had happened. The smaller
twins had gone to bed, the “sandman” having
paid them an early visit.</p>

<p>Nan went up to see if Mrs. Pry wanted
anything, and gave her some of the medicine
the doctor had left for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“It’s snowing yet,” Nan said to the old
lady.</p>

<p>“What’s that? You say the kitten’s got a
fit?” cried Mrs. Pry. “Land sakes! Well,
put it down the cellar!”</p>

<p>“No, no! The kitten hasn’t a fit! I said
it was snowing <em>yet</em>!” said Nan loudly.</p>

<p>“Oh! More snow! Seems like it was
never going to stop! I do hope the house
keeps warm, for my pains seem to be getting
worse.”</p>

<p>Nan was more lonesome than ever that
night, wished more for her father and mother,
but she said nothing to Bert about it. She
was the first up the next morning, and she
felt a sense of chill as she moved about dressing.</p>

<p>“Bert! Bert!” she softly called to her
brother, so as not to awaken Flossie and
Freddie. “I’m afraid the fire has gone out,
Bert, or else it’s very low. You’d better look
after it.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Bert sleepily as he got out of
bed and hastily dressed to go down cellar.
As Nan put the coffee on to boil, so Mrs. Pry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
could have an early, hot cup, the girl heard
her brother rattling away at the furnace.</p>

<p>“Fire’s out,” he called up. “But I’ll soon
have it going again.”</p>

<p>He piled in wood and lighted the paper,
and then, after putting on some coal, came
upstairs.</p>

<p>“It will soon be warm,” he said.</p>

<p>“I hope so!” exclaimed Nan, shivering as
she set the table for breakfast.</p>

<p>Flossie and Freddie were just awakening
when Nan carried up Mrs. Pry some toast
and coffee and an egg. The old lady sat up
in bed and suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Nan, I smell smoke!”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s the toast,” Nan answered.
“One slice burned a little.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t toast!” insisted Aunt Sallie.
“I know the smell of burned toast! This is
burning wood! I hope the chimney isn’t on
fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I guess it isn’t,” replied Nan.
“Bert just made up a new fire in the
furnace.”</p>

<p>Just then Freddie cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, look at the smoke! There’s a lot of
smoke out in the hall!”</p>

<p>Nan looked out of Mrs. Pry’s room.
Truly the hall was filling with a blue, choking
haze.</p>

<p>“It’s a fire!” screamed Flossie. “Bert!
Nan! The house is on fire!”</p>

<p>More smoke welled up until Nan and the
small twins were choking and gasping.</p>

<p>“Bert! Bert!” shouted Nan, running down
the stairs. “What is the matter? Is the
house on fire?”</p>

<h3>JUST IN TIME</h3>


<p>Bert Bobbsey, who had gone out to clear
some of the snow from the side porch, hurried
back into the house just as Nan called to
him. He, also, saw and smelled the smoke.
And he heard the cries of fire, not only
shouted by Flossie and Freddie, but also by
Mrs. Pry.</p>

<p>The old lady in her excitement, and in
spite of the pain in her back, had gotten out
of bed and was hurrying around the room,
gathering up such of her things as she could
find.</p>

<p>“Bert! Bert!” cried Nan again. “What is
it? Is the house on fire?”</p>

<p>Much as he feared to admit this, Bert began
to think it was what had, most unfortunately,
happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“Guess I made too much of a blaze in the
furnace!” gasped the boy.</p>

<p>Nan saw Bert rushing for the door leading
to the cellar.</p>

<p>“Don’t go down there!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to! That’s where the fire has
started!” he called back. “I’ll see if I can’t
put it out before it gets any worse.”</p>

<p>“No! No!” shouted Nan. “You’ll get
burned. If the house is on fire we must telephone
in an alarm. Mother always said to
call the engines first thing! Telephone in
the alarm, Bert!”</p>

<p>“I can’t telephone the alarm in, Nan,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“The telephone’s broken! I’ll have to run
down the street and pull the box!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you go next door and telephone?”
Nan wanted to know. “Oh, of course you
can’t! Oh, it’s getting worse, Bert!”</p>

<p>It surely was—at least the smoke was.</p>

<p>“Get Flossie and Freddie out!” gasped the
boy. “And Aunt Sallie! Never mind the
house—let it burn!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Bert Bobbsey! Let our lovely house
burn!”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t put it out, can we? Get
Flossie and Freddie out and Mrs. Pry! I’ll
go pull the fire box!”</p>

<p>It seemed the best thing to do. Upstairs
ran Nan to the playroom where Flossie and
Freddie were crying, for they were much
frightened.</p>

<p>“Come!” called Nan. “We must get out!
The house is burning!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take my dolls!” exclaimed
Flossie, catching two or three of her most
cherished ones in her arms.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to take my fire engine!”
shouted Freddie. “If it was a bigger one,
maybe it could put out the fire.”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop to pick up any of your toys!”
ordered Nan. “But come with me!”</p>

<p>She caught the children, each by an arm,
and fairly pulled them out into the hall. At
the same time she cried:</p>

<p>“Can you get down, Aunt Sallie? The
house is on fire!”</p>

<p>“No need to tell me that!” cried the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
lady, who seemed suddenly to forget about
her aches and pains. “I can smell smoke,
even if I am a little deaf!”</p>

<p>She hobbled out into the hall, having
slipped a warm bathrobe on. In one hand
she carried her shoes, and in the other her
half-filled valise, while under her arms she
had bundles of her clothing.</p>

<p>“Land sakes, this is terrible! Driven out
in the middle of winter!” she cried.</p>

<p>As Bert opened the front door to rush down
the street to the nearest fire box he almost
fell off the porch in his excitement, for, rushing
up the front walk was—his father!</p>

<p>And behind him came Mrs. Bobbsey!</p>

<p>“Bert! Bert!” cried his father, seeing the
smoke. “What has happened?”</p>

<p>“House on fire!” shouted Bert. “I’m going
to turn in the alarm! Telephone’s
broke!”</p>

<p>As he swung out of the gate Bert was given
a further surprise by colliding with Sam
Johnson, who dropped the valise he was carrying.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de lan’ sakes!” gasped Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>The breath was almost knocked out of
Bert, but he had a vision of fat Dinah waddling
up the street. At first Bert thought it
was all a dream—his father and mother and
Sam and Dinah all coming home at once and
so unexpectedly! But he was soon sure it
was no dream, and certainly the smoke pouring
out of the front door was real enough.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sam! The house is on fire!” cried
Mrs. Bobbsey. “Where are the children?
Nan! Flossie! Freddie! And where’s Mrs.
Pry?”</p>

<p>“They’re coming out!” cried Bert. “You
look after them. I’ll get the engines!”</p>

<p>“Don’t get de engines!” shouted Sam.
“Don’t!”</p>

<p>“But the house is on fire!” exclaimed Mr.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“No it ain’t!” insisted Sam. “I know whut
it is. I kin tell by de smell ob de smoke. It’s
de furnace in de cellar. Did you put on
wood, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I just made a new fire!”</p>

<p>“It’s de furnace all right,” said Sam. “You
done got de damper turned de wrong way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
It happened to me once. It’s gwine to be aw
right in a minute. De house ain’t on fire.
It’s jest de furnace. I’ll fix her!”</p>

<p>He dashed into the house and down the cellar
steps. By this time Nan, with the smaller
twins and Aunt Sallie, reached the front steps.</p>

<p>In spite of the cold, a crowd was gathering
in the street, attracted by the smoke, and several
men offered to turn in an alarm, but Mr.
Bobbsey told them to wait. In a minute or
two Sam came out again, his eyes running
with tears on account of the smoke.</p>

<p>“Dat’s just whut I t’ought it was,” he
gasped. “Damper turned de wrong way. De
furnace has stopped smokin’ now, an’ I
opened a lot of windows. We kin go back in
de house soon.”</p>

<p>In a little while, they could do so. With
the damper properly turned, the smoke from
the new fire in the furnace went up the chimney,
as it should, and through the open windows
the smoke in the house soon blew out.</p>

<p>“Well, my poor dears, what a fright you
must have had!” said Mrs. Bobbsey, holding
Flossie and Freddie on her lap while Bert and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
Nan stood near. “And all alone, too! We
didn’t know until a little while ago that Sam
and Dinah were away. But I suppose Mrs.
Pry looked after you.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m sorry to say, I couldn’t,” said
Mrs. Pry, who had by this time put on a few
clothes. “I was taken with the lumbago soon
after Dinah went away, and these children
have been keeping house by themselves. And
very well they did it, too!”</p>

<p>“You ought to get back in bed, Aunt Sallie,
with your lumbago!” said Nan. “The doctor
said we must keep you warm.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did, my dear,” said Aunt Sallie,
with a smile. “But I never thought, and I
don’t believe he did, either, that you’d make
me think the house was on fire to keep me
warm. But I don’t seem to have any lumbago
left. I feel much better. I guess the
fright cured me.”</p>

<p>And so it seemed, for Aunt Sallie moved
about as well as before she had had to go to
bed.</p>

<p>The Bobbsey twins got over their fright,
and the crowd, which had feared the Bobbsey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
house was burning, moved away. Sam
made the fire good and hot, without letting
it smoke. The house was soon put to rights
again. And once more there were happy,
smiling faces.</p>

<p>“But we didn’t know you were coming
home,” said Nan to her mother. “Is Uncle
Rossiter better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s all right. We sent you word
that we were coming, but I guess you didn’t
get any mail. We had none from you.”</p>

<p>“The storm was too bad,” stated Bert.
“And didn’t you know Sam had to go away
and then Dinah had to go after Sam?”</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t know a thing about it,” said
Mr. Bobbsey. “Coming home on the train
we saw Sam and Dinah get on at the junction
early this morning, and that was the first we
knew they had had to leave.”</p>

<p>Dinah explained that she had found Sam
not as sick as at first reported, and she soon
had him “on his feet again,” as she called it.
His brother, too, got better, so there was no
need of Sam’s remaining in the South, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
the two faithful servants hurried back as soon
as they could.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you’re all back!” exclaimed
Nan. “It’s been hard work, keeping
house alone.”</p>

<p>“It must have been, my dear,” said her
mother. “You were brave children. So
many things must have happened.”</p>

<p>“There did,” sighed Nan.</p>

<p>“I sat in the biksits!” laughed Flossie.</p>

<p>“And Bert fell off the roof!” said Freddie.</p>

<p>“And the window’s broke!” added Flossie.</p>

<p>Then all the happenings were told, including
how Bert found Danny’s ring in the
church.</p>

<p>A few days after that the weather cleared
and it grew warmer. School resumed, and
one of the first things done was to make
Danny Rugg get up in front of all the classes
and tell that he had broken the window.
Thus was Bert’s name cleared and Sam Todd
was made to apologize to him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad this is over,” said the principal.
“I congratulate you, Bert Bobbsey!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>And Bert felt very happy.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you don’t need me any
more,” said Mrs. Pry a few days later.</p>

<p>“But we hope you’ll come and see us some
other time,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Aunt Sallie. “Is
the kitten hanging on the line?”</p>

<p>When it was explained to her what Mrs.
Bobbsey had said, Aunt Sallie joined in
laughing at her mistake.</p>

<p>And now that we can leave them happy
and contented, we shall say good-bye to the
children until we meet them again. An interesting
vacation was to come to them soon,
to be called, “The Bobbsey Twins at Clover
Bank.”</p>

<p>As Daddy Bobbsey was leaving for work
one morning he smiled to himself, for he had
just heard this conversation:</p>

<p>“Let’s play house!” Freddie had suggested.</p>

<p>“I’ll be Aunt Sallie,” shouted Flossie.</p>

<p>“We’ll not sit in biscuits!” laughed Nan.</p>

<p>“Nor have a fire!” added Bert.</p>
